  Quantum Zeno effect, Authors: J. Dong, W. T. He, S. D. Zou, D. L. Zhou, Q. Ai, Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under
Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

  Quantum Zeno effect, Authors: J. Dong, W. T. He, S. D. Zou, D. L. Zhou, Q. Ai, Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under
Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

  Quantum Zeno effect, Authors: J. Dong, W. T. He, S. D. Zou, D. L. Zhou, Q. Ai, Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under
Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

  Quantum Zeno effect, Authors: J. Dong, W. T. He, S. D. Zou, D. L. Zhou, Q. Ai, Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under
Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

            Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under

theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothe tical particles, facilitated by
quantum ampliﬁcation, are crucial for advancing fundament al physics and its practical applications.
Recently, it was experimentally observed that magnetic ﬁel d can be ampliﬁed by using nuclear
spins under Markovian noise, [ H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024) ]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-ﬁeld signa l by using nuclear spins by the quantum
Zeno eﬀect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we demonstra te that compared to the Markovian
case the ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld can be enhanc ed by a factor about e1/ 2 under a
Gaussian noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations w e determine the optimal experimental
parameters for ampliﬁcation conditions. This work shows th at the combination of the QZE and
spin ampliﬁcation eﬀectively enhances the ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld. Our ﬁndings
may provide valuable guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.
I. INTRODUCTION
According to astrophysical observations, roughly ﬁve
sixths of the matter in the universe remains dark
[
1]. However, direct detection of its interactions with
particles and ﬁelds of the standard model remains
elusive [
2]. There are a variety of particle candidates
for dark matter, such as quantum chromodynamics
axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) [
3], new Z′
bosons [ 4], new spin-1 bosons [ 5] and dark photons
[6, 7]. Axions are prominent dark-matter and dark-
energy candidates, which are introduced as a compelling
solution to the strong-CP problem beyond the standard
model. However, it is insuﬃcient to search for ALPs
by traditional particle-physics techniques with light
quanta such as the Large Hadron Collider [
8, 9].
Therefore, experimental searches for axion-like dark
matter are based on their non-gravitational interactions
with particles and ﬁelds of the standard model [
8–14].
As known to all, quantum ampliﬁcation plays
an important role in quantum metrology and ﬁnds
applications in the measurements of weak ﬁeld and
force [
15–18], and optical ampliﬁcation [ 19] to search for
new physics beyond the standard model [ 10]. Besides,
the magnetic-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation ﬁnds applications in
a wide range of searching axion-nucleon interactions,
such as ALPs and axion bursts from astrophysical
events [
20, 21]. Under the state-of-art experiments,
the sensitivity has exceeded astrophysical limits [ 22] by
several orders of magnitude. We note that both electron
∗ aiqing@bnu.edu.cn
and nuclear spins have shown great potential for realizing
signal ampliﬁcation. For example, the overlapping spin
ensemble, e.g.129Xe-87Rb, is used in self-compensating
comagnetometers [
23–25]. Recently, the magnetic-ﬁeld
ampliﬁcation using 129Xe noble gas overlapping with
spin-polarized 87Rb atomic gas is demonstrated, which
has achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in ampliﬁcation
of weak-ﬁeld measurements under the Markovian noise,
i.e., a constant spin relaxation rate [
26].
On the other hand, the QZE describes the phenomenon
that a quantum system’s dynamic evolution drastically
slows down when measured frequently enough [
27–
31]. The QZE plays a pivotal role in various domains
of quantum science. One of the applications of the
QZE is the quantum measurements, which can suppress
the detrimental eﬀects of decoherence [
32, 33]. By
performing frequent error-correction measurements, the
QZE helps stabilize the quantum state of qubits, thereby
prolonging their coherence time and enhancing the
reliability of quantum computations. Both theoretically
and experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the
QZE can enhance the quantum metrology by using
the maximum-entangled states [
34–36]. So far, the
QZE has been experimentally observed in a number of
physical systems such as trapped ions [
37, 38], ultracold
atoms [ 39–41], molecules [ 42], Bose-Einstein condensates
[43], nitrogen-vacancy centers [ 44] and superconducting
quantum circuits [ 45–48].
To achieve the more signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of
external magnetic ﬁelds, in this paper, we propose a
magnetic-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation using noble gas overlapping
with spin-polarized alkali-metal gas by the QZE, which
can achieve an improvement in the ampliﬁcation of
weak-ﬁeld measurements as compared to the Markovian
2
case. In weak magnetic ﬁelds, we obtain the
analytical solution to the dynamics of129Xe spins and
ampliﬁcation function, which present an enhancement
ofe1/ 2 compared to Markovian case. In the case of
strong magnetic ﬁelds, we further examine the response
of the129Xe spins by numerical simulations under
various conditions. Then, we provide the optimal
measurement parameters for the practical experiments,
i.e., the detuning between the Larmor frequency and
the frequency of magnetic ﬁeld, the decoherence time,
and the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld. We anticipate
that the present ampliﬁcation technique could stimulate
possible applications in applied and fundamental physics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
model is set up and the response of polarized 129Xe spins
to a transverse oscillating magnetic ﬁeld is derived in
Sec.
II. Then, the response of polarized 129Xe spins in the
case of weak magnetic ﬁelds is investigated in Sec. III. In
Sec. IV, the transverse polarization of the polarized 129Xe
spins is studied and the optimal ampliﬁcation is explored
in the case of strong magnetic ﬁelds. A summary is
concluded in Sec.
V.
II. MODEL
According to Ref. [ 49], there are two cells containing
nuclear spins, i.e., the source and the sensor cells. In
order to polarize the Rb spins and thus the129Xe nuclear
spins, a static magnetic ﬁeld with strength B0 is applied
along z-axis. Due to the axion-mediated interaction
between polarized neutrons, the 129Xe nuclear spins are
also subject to a time-dependent transverse magnetic
ﬁeld. As a result, the129Xe nuclear spin in a magnetic
ﬁeld is described by the following Hamiltonian
ˆH = −γnB(t) · ˆI, (1)
where B(t) = B0 ˆz + Bac cos(2πνt)ˆy is the total ﬁeld
experienced by 129Xe nuclear spins with ν being the
Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins in the source cell,
γn = 2 π × 11.78 Hz/ µT [
26] and ˆI = ( ˆIx, ˆIy, ˆIz ) are the
gyromagnetic ratio and the angular momentum operators
of129Xe, respectively. Thus, the Larmor frequency of
129Xe is
ν0 = γnB0
2π , (2)
where γn is the gyromagnetic ratio of 129Xe. The spin
Hamiltonian with the total ﬁeld reads explicitly
ˆH = −γnB0 ˆIz − γnBac cos(2πνt)ˆIy. (3)
According to the Heisenberg equation of motion, we
can obtain the dynamical equation for the nuclear spin
angular momentum as
dˆIx
dt = γnB0 ˆIy − γnBac cos(2πνt)ˆIz , (4)
dˆIy
dt = −γnB0 ˆIx, (5)
dˆIz
dt = γnBac cos(2πνt) ˆIx. (6)
The polarization of 129Xe atoms can be deﬁned as
P = ⟨ˆI⟩
v0
, (7)
where v−1
0 is the atomic number density. The dynamics
of the three polarization components can be described by
the Bloch equations as [
50]
dPx
dt = γnB0Py − γnBac cos(2πνt)Pz , (8)
dPy
dt = −γnB0Px, (9)
dPz
dt = γnBac cos(2πνt)Px. (10)
Generally speaking, any quantum system inevitably
suﬀers from the interaction with its environment. On
account of a Markovian noise, the dynamics of129Xe
spins can be described with the Bloch equations
dPx
dt = γnB0Py − γnBac cos(2πνt)Pz − 1

where T1 (T2) is the longitudinal (transverse) relaxation
time of 129Xe spin. We consider the response of polarized
129Xe spins to a transverse oscillating magnetic ﬁeld.
Considering a Gaussian noise, the dynamics of 129Xe
spins can be described by the Bloch equation as [ 51]

To analyze the system more conveniently, we transform
it to the rotating frame deﬁned by
ˆU = ei2πνt ˆIz . (17)
In the rotating frame, the eﬀective Hamiltonian
ˆ
˜H = ˆU† ˆH ˆU − i ˆU† ddt
ˆU (18)
3
can be simpliﬁed as
ˆ
˜H ≈ ∆ ˆIz − 12γnBac ˆIy, (19)
where ∆ = 2 π(ν − ν0) is the detuning, and we have
dropped the fast-oscillating terms by the rotating-wave
approximation [
30, 51]. Thus, the Bloch equations of
129Xe spins in the rotating frame read
˙˜Px = γnBac

˙˜Pz = − γnBac

˜Pz, (22)
where ˜Pα (α = x, y, z ) are the polarization of 129Xe spins
in the rotating frame. According to Eq. ( 2), we can deﬁne
the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld in the rotating frame as ˜B =
(Bac/2)ˆy − (∆ /γn)ˆz.
When the Rb pump light is oﬀ, the eﬀective magnetic-
ﬁeld gradient induced by the Rb polarization is greatly
suppressed, resulting inT2 being close to T1 [
49]. As a
result, we assume T2 ≈ T1 = T and thus we have
˙˜Px = γnBac

III. LINEAR RESPONSE
In practical applications, precise measurement of weak
magnetic ﬁelds is often of great interest, such as those
associated with precision medicine, deep-sea exploration
and cardiac activity, etc [
26]. When Bac is weak enough,
we can ignore the ﬁrst term in Eq. ( 25). In this case,
the time evolution of ˜Pz is decoupled with ˜Px, ˜Py and
Bac. And ˜Px exhibits a linear dependence on Bac.
Under the weak-ﬁeld approximation, Eqs. ( 23)-(25) can
be simpliﬁed as
˙˜Px = γnBac
2
˜Pz + ∆ ˜Py − t
T 2
˜Px, (26)
˙˜Py = −∆ ˜Px − t
T 2
˜Py, (27)
˙˜Pz = − t
T 2
˜Pz. (28)
When the polarization is initially along z-axis, i.e., P(t =
0) = (0 , 0, P0), the solutions to the above equations can
be expressed as follows
˜Px = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin(∆ t), (29)
˜Py = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [cos(∆ t) − 1], (30)
˜Pz = P0e− t2
2T 2 . (31)
Since the relation between the polarization in the
rotating frame and the laboratory frame is
Px(t) = ˜Px(t) cos(ωt) − ˜Py(t) sin(ωt), (32)
Py(t) = ˜Px(t) sin(ωt) + ˜Py(t) cos(ωt), (33)
Pz(t) = ˜Pz(t), (34)
we can obtain the polarization in the laboratory frame
as
Px = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [sin(∆ t − ωt) + sin( ωt)] , (35)
Py = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [cos(∆ t − ωt) − cos(ωt)] , (36)
Pz = P0e− t2
2T 2 . (37)
Thus, the magnitude of the transverse polarization can
be expressed as
P⊥ = P0Bacγn
∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin
( ∆ t
2
)
. (38)
According to Beﬀ = 8 πκ0M0P⊥/3, where κ0 = 540
denotes the Fermi-contact enhancement factor between
129Xe and 87Rb [
26, 52], the amplitude of the transverse
eﬀective ﬁeld is
Beﬀ = 8π
3 κ0M0
P0Bacγn
∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin
( ∆ t

)
. (39)
And thus the transverse ﬁeld is ampliﬁed by a factor
Π ≡ |Beﬀ |
|Bac| = 2λMnγn
∆ sin
( ∆ t
2
)
e− t2
2T 2 , (40)
where Mn = M0P0 is the nuclear magnetization of
129Xe, λ = 4 πκ0/3. The optimal time topt can be
obtained by calculating ∂Π /∂t|t=topt = 0, and thus
yields tan (∆ topt/2) = ∆ T 2/2topt. Now we expand
tan(∆ topt/2) to the third order of ∆ topt and obtain
the following expression (∆ topt/2) + (∆ topt/2)3 /3 =
∆ T 2/2topt. The time required to reach the maximum
transverse polarization is determined by
topt =




∆ 2
(
−1 +

. (41)
Again by Taylor expansion, we could obtain
topt ≃ T
(
1 − ∆ 2T 2
24
)
. (42)

Based on this ﬁnding, it is shown that the optimal time
becomes longer asT increases and ∆ decreases, which
will be discussed in detail in the next section.
When the oscillation frequency of the external
magnetic ﬁeld matches the 129Xe Larmor frequency,
i.e., ∆ = 0, the time required to reach the maximum
transverse polarization istopt = T . It should be noted
that the optimal time should be smaller than T in
the non-resonance case, i.e., ∆ ̸= 0. The optimal
ampliﬁcation factors for the Markovian and QZE cases
are Π = 2λMnγnT e−1 [
26] and Π = 2 λMnγnT e−1/ 2,
respectively. Therefore, the QZE could enhance the
ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld by a factor√

FIG. 1. Time evolution of the transverse polarization P⊥
vs Bac for (a) the Gaussian and (b) the Markovian noise,
respectively. Solid lines represent the proﬁles under the l inear-
response approximation while symbols represent the proﬁle s
by the numerically-exact solution. The parameters T = 380 s
and ∆ = 2 . 5 mHz are used.
In the following, we will obtain the response of the
129Xe spins without the weak-ﬁeld approximation but
by solving Eqs. ( 23)-(25) numerically. Figure 1 shows
P⊥ against time in the QZE and Markovian case [ 26],
respectively. In order to verify the validity of the weak-
ﬁeld approximation, we compare the linear response with
the nonlinear response under diﬀerent amplitudes of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The approximated and the exact proﬁles
almost overlap with each other when the measured ﬁeld
is 10 pT. However, as the magnetic ﬁeld increases, their
diﬀerence becomes larger and larger, which suggests that
the approximation works well in the case of weak ﬁelds.
Most importantly, it is clearly observed that the response
in the former case is signiﬁcantly larger than that in the
latter, indicating that the magnetic ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed
more eﬀectively by the QZE.

Figure 2 compares the optimal response P opt

coherence times. It is shown that the optimal responses
in both cases exhibit the same trend, gradually increasing
withT . Furthermore, the response increases with the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld for a given coherence
timeT . Interestingly, it is evident that the responses in
the QZE consistently exceed those in the Markovian case.

FIG. 3. The optimal transverse polarization P opt
⊥ in (a) the
QZE and (b) the Markovian cases as a function of detuning
∆ for diﬀerentBacs. The other parameters are the same as
those used in Fig.
1.
In order to evaluate the eﬀect of the detuning ∆ on the
ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 3,
we compare the optimal responses under the QZE with
those in the Markovian case for diﬀerentBacs by solving
Eqs. (
23)-(25) numerically. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the
optimal response decreases monotonically with increasing
detuning for a ﬁxed value ofBac. Therefore, in order
5
to achieve a larger ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic
ﬁeld, the resonance between the driving ﬁeld and Larmor
frequency is required. Furthermore, the optimal response
shows a gradual increase as the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is enhanced for a constant detuning. Since we employ
the QZE to amplify the weak magnetic ﬁeld, we further
investigate the optimal responses in the Markovian noise
in Fig.
3(b). For all Bacs, the optimal response is always
smaller than the counterparts in the QZE.

FIG. 4. Dependence of the optimal time topt on (a) the
relaxation time T with ∆ = 2 . 5 mHz and (b) the detuning ∆
with T = 380 s for the QZE in diﬀerent Bacs.
In Fig. 4, we present the optimal time topt to perform
the measurement as a function of the relaxation time
Tand detuning ∆ for the QZE, respectively. It is
demonstrated that topt is proportional to T for Bac =
10 pT, which is consistent with Eq. (
42). However,
as Bac increases, the time required to achieve the
optimal response decreases for a given T . On the
other hand, when talking about the dependence of the
optimal measurement time on ∆, it turns out to be
much complicated. It requires the longest time to
achieve the optimal response for the resonance case,
whiletopt decreases as the detuning is enlarged, which
is predicted by Eq. (
42). Notably, for diﬀerent magnetic
ﬁelds, all curves coincide with each other in the large-
detuning limit. These ﬁndings suggest that maximizing
the relaxation time while minimizing the detuning is
crucial for expediting the ampliﬁcation of the weak
magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, careful control of these parameters
is essential to enhance the eﬃciency and precision of the
measurement process.
Since in Fig.
3(a), the optimal responses increase as the
magnetic ﬁeld is enlarged, it may be quite natural to ask
whether there exists a bound for the optimal response.
As depicted in Fig.
5, we explore the optimal response
for diﬀerent sets of ( Bac, ∆). When the system is at
resonance, the optimal response will quickly be saturated
as the magnetic ﬁeld is enlarged. As the detuning
increases, the smallest magnetic ﬁeld to saturate optimal

            Title: Searching Axion-like Dark Matter by Amplifying Weak Magnetic Field with
  Quantum Zeno effect
            Authors: J. Dong, W. T. He, S. D. Zou, D. L. Zhou, Q. Ai
            Abstract:   The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,
facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental
physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally
observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under
Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear
spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we
demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak
magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian
noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal
experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the
combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the
amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable
guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.

The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothe tical particles, facilitated by
quantum ampliﬁcation, are crucial for advancing fundament al physics and its practical applications.
Recently, it was experimentally observed that magnetic ﬁel d can be ampliﬁed by using nuclear
spins under Markovian noise, [ H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024) ]. Here, we
theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-ﬁeld signa l by using nuclear spins by the quantum
Zeno eﬀect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we demonstra te that compared to the Markovian
case the ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld can be enhanc ed by a factor about e1/ 2 under a
Gaussian noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations w e determine the optimal experimental
parameters for ampliﬁcation conditions. This work shows th at the combination of the QZE and
spin ampliﬁcation eﬀectively enhances the ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld. Our ﬁndings
may provide valuable guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark
matter and exotic interactions in the near future.
I. INTRODUCTION
According to astrophysical observations, roughly ﬁve
sixths of the matter in the universe remains dark
[
1]. However, direct detection of its interactions with
particles and ﬁelds of the standard model remains
elusive [
2]. There are a variety of particle candidates
for dark matter, such as quantum chromodynamics
axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) [
3], new Z′
bosons [ 4], new spin-1 bosons [ 5] and dark photons
[6, 7]. Axions are prominent dark-matter and dark-
energy candidates, which are introduced as a compelling
solution to the strong-CP problem beyond the standard
model. However, it is insuﬃcient to search for ALPs
by traditional particle-physics techniques with light
quanta such as the Large Hadron Collider [
8, 9].
Therefore, experimental searches for axion-like dark
matter are based on their non-gravitational interactions
with particles and ﬁelds of the standard model [
8–14].
As known to all, quantum ampliﬁcation plays
an important role in quantum metrology and ﬁnds
applications in the measurements of weak ﬁeld and
force [
15–18], and optical ampliﬁcation [ 19] to search for
new physics beyond the standard model [ 10]. Besides,
the magnetic-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation ﬁnds applications in
a wide range of searching axion-nucleon interactions,
such as ALPs and axion bursts from astrophysical
events [
20, 21]. Under the state-of-art experiments,
the sensitivity has exceeded astrophysical limits [ 22] by
several orders of magnitude. We note that both electron
∗ aiqing@bnu.edu.cn
and nuclear spins have shown great potential for realizing
signal ampliﬁcation. For example, the overlapping spin
ensemble, e.g.129Xe-87Rb, is used in self-compensating
comagnetometers [
23–25]. Recently, the magnetic-ﬁeld
ampliﬁcation using 129Xe noble gas overlapping with
spin-polarized 87Rb atomic gas is demonstrated, which
has achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in ampliﬁcation
of weak-ﬁeld measurements under the Markovian noise,
i.e., a constant spin relaxation rate [
26].
On the other hand, the QZE describes the phenomenon
that a quantum system’s dynamic evolution drastically
slows down when measured frequently enough [
27–
31]. The QZE plays a pivotal role in various domains
of quantum science. One of the applications of the
QZE is the quantum measurements, which can suppress
the detrimental eﬀects of decoherence [
32, 33]. By
performing frequent error-correction measurements, the
QZE helps stabilize the quantum state of qubits, thereby
prolonging their coherence time and enhancing the
reliability of quantum computations. Both theoretically
and experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the
QZE can enhance the quantum metrology by using
the maximum-entangled states [
34–36]. So far, the
QZE has been experimentally observed in a number of
physical systems such as trapped ions [
37, 38], ultracold
atoms [ 39–41], molecules [ 42], Bose-Einstein condensates
[43], nitrogen-vacancy centers [ 44] and superconducting
quantum circuits [ 45–48].
To achieve the more signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of
external magnetic ﬁelds, in this paper, we propose a
magnetic-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation using noble gas overlapping
with spin-polarized alkali-metal gas by the QZE, which
can achieve an improvement in the ampliﬁcation of
weak-ﬁeld measurements as compared to the Markovian
2
case. In weak magnetic ﬁelds, we obtain the
analytical solution to the dynamics of129Xe spins and
ampliﬁcation function, which present an enhancement
ofe1/ 2 compared to Markovian case. In the case of
strong magnetic ﬁelds, we further examine the response
of the129Xe spins by numerical simulations under
various conditions. Then, we provide the optimal
measurement parameters for the practical experiments,
i.e., the detuning between the Larmor frequency and
the frequency of magnetic ﬁeld, the decoherence time,
and the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld. We anticipate
that the present ampliﬁcation technique could stimulate
possible applications in applied and fundamental physics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
model is set up and the response of polarized 129Xe spins
to a transverse oscillating magnetic ﬁeld is derived in
Sec.
II. Then, the response of polarized 129Xe spins in the
case of weak magnetic ﬁelds is investigated in Sec. III. In
Sec. IV, the transverse polarization of the polarized 129Xe
spins is studied and the optimal ampliﬁcation is explored
in the case of strong magnetic ﬁelds. A summary is
concluded in Sec.
V.
II. MODEL
According to Ref. [ 49], there are two cells containing
nuclear spins, i.e., the source and the sensor cells. In
order to polarize the Rb spins and thus the129Xe nuclear
spins, a static magnetic ﬁeld with strength B0 is applied
along z-axis. Due to the axion-mediated interaction
between polarized neutrons, the 129Xe nuclear spins are
also subject to a time-dependent transverse magnetic
ﬁeld. As a result, the129Xe nuclear spin in a magnetic
ﬁeld is described by the following Hamiltonian
ˆH = −γnB(t) · ˆI, (1)
where B(t) = B0 ˆz + Bac cos(2πνt)ˆy is the total ﬁeld
experienced by 129Xe nuclear spins with ν being the
Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins in the source cell,
γn = 2 π × 11.78 Hz/ µT [
26] and ˆI = ( ˆIx, ˆIy, ˆIz ) are the
gyromagnetic ratio and the angular momentum operators
of129Xe, respectively. Thus, the Larmor frequency of
129Xe is
ν0 = γnB0
2π , (2)
where γn is the gyromagnetic ratio of 129Xe. The spin
Hamiltonian with the total ﬁeld reads explicitly
ˆH = −γnB0 ˆIz − γnBac cos(2πνt)ˆIy. (3)
According to the Heisenberg equation of motion, we
can obtain the dynamical equation for the nuclear spin
angular momentum as
dˆIx
dt = γnB0 ˆIy − γnBac cos(2πνt)ˆIz , (4)
dˆIy
dt = −γnB0 ˆIx, (5)
dˆIz
dt = γnBac cos(2πνt) ˆIx. (6)
The polarization of 129Xe atoms can be deﬁned as
P = ⟨ˆI⟩
v0
, (7)
where v−1
0 is the atomic number density. The dynamics
of the three polarization components can be described by
the Bloch equations as [
50]
dPx
dt = γnB0Py − γnBac cos(2πνt)Pz , (8)
dPy
dt = −γnB0Px, (9)
dPz
dt = γnBac cos(2πνt)Px. (10)
Generally speaking, any quantum system inevitably
suﬀers from the interaction with its environment. On
account of a Markovian noise, the dynamics of129Xe
spins can be described with the Bloch equations
dPx
dt = γnB0Py − γnBac cos(2πνt)Pz − 1

where T1 (T2) is the longitudinal (transverse) relaxation
time of 129Xe spin. We consider the response of polarized
129Xe spins to a transverse oscillating magnetic ﬁeld.
Considering a Gaussian noise, the dynamics of 129Xe
spins can be described by the Bloch equation as [ 51]

To analyze the system more conveniently, we transform
it to the rotating frame deﬁned by
ˆU = ei2πνt ˆIz . (17)
In the rotating frame, the eﬀective Hamiltonian
ˆ
˜H = ˆU† ˆH ˆU − i ˆU† ddt
ˆU (18)
3
can be simpliﬁed as
ˆ
˜H ≈ ∆ ˆIz − 12γnBac ˆIy, (19)
where ∆ = 2 π(ν − ν0) is the detuning, and we have
dropped the fast-oscillating terms by the rotating-wave
approximation [
30, 51]. Thus, the Bloch equations of
129Xe spins in the rotating frame read
˙˜Px = γnBac

˜Pz + ∆ ˜Py − t

˜Pz, (22)
where ˜Pα (α = x, y, z ) are the polarization of 129Xe spins
in the rotating frame. According to Eq. ( 2), we can deﬁne
the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld in the rotating frame as ˜B =
(Bac/2)ˆy − (∆ /γn)ˆz.
When the Rb pump light is oﬀ, the eﬀective magnetic-
ﬁeld gradient induced by the Rb polarization is greatly
suppressed, resulting inT2 being close to T1 [
49]. As a
result, we assume T2 ≈ T1 = T and thus we have
˙˜Px = γnBac

III. LINEAR RESPONSE
In practical applications, precise measurement of weak
magnetic ﬁelds is often of great interest, such as those
associated with precision medicine, deep-sea exploration
and cardiac activity, etc [
26]. When Bac is weak enough,
we can ignore the ﬁrst term in Eq. ( 25). In this case,
the time evolution of ˜Pz is decoupled with ˜Px, ˜Py and
Bac. And ˜Px exhibits a linear dependence on Bac.
Under the weak-ﬁeld approximation, Eqs. ( 23)-(25) can
be simpliﬁed as
˙˜Px = γnBac
2
˜Pz + ∆ ˜Py − t
T 2
˜Px, (26)
˙˜Py = −∆ ˜Px − t
T 2
˜Py, (27)
˙˜Pz = − t
T 2
˜Pz. (28)
When the polarization is initially along z-axis, i.e., P(t =
0) = (0 , 0, P0), the solutions to the above equations can
be expressed as follows
˜Px = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin(∆ t), (29)
˜Py = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [cos(∆ t) − 1], (30)
˜Pz = P0e− t2
2T 2 . (31)
Since the relation between the polarization in the
rotating frame and the laboratory frame is
Px(t) = ˜Px(t) cos(ωt) − ˜Py(t) sin(ωt), (32)
Py(t) = ˜Px(t) sin(ωt) + ˜Py(t) cos(ωt), (33)
Pz(t) = ˜Pz(t), (34)
we can obtain the polarization in the laboratory frame
as
Px = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [sin(∆ t − ωt) + sin( ωt)] , (35)
Py = P0Bacγn
2∆ e− t2
2T 2 [cos(∆ t − ωt) − cos(ωt)] , (36)
Pz = P0e− t2
2T 2 . (37)
Thus, the magnitude of the transverse polarization can
be expressed as
P⊥ = P0Bacγn
∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin
( ∆ t
2
)
. (38)
According to Beﬀ = 8 πκ0M0P⊥/3, where κ0 = 540
denotes the Fermi-contact enhancement factor between
129Xe and 87Rb [
26, 52], the amplitude of the transverse
eﬀective ﬁeld is
Beﬀ = 8π
3 κ0M0
P0Bacγn
∆ e− t2
2T 2 sin
( ∆ t
2
)
. (39)
And thus the transverse ﬁeld is ampliﬁed by a factor
Π ≡ |Beﬀ |
|Bac| = 2λMnγn
∆ sin
( ∆ t
2
)
e− t2
2T 2 , (40)
where Mn = M0P0 is the nuclear magnetization of
129Xe, λ = 4 πκ0/3. The optimal time topt can be
obtained by calculating ∂Π /∂t|t=topt = 0, and thus
yields tan (∆ topt/2) = ∆ T 2/2topt. Now we expand
tan(∆ topt/2) to the third order of ∆ topt and obtain
the following expression (∆ topt/2) + (∆ topt/2)3 /3 =
∆ T 2/2topt. The time required to reach the maximum
transverse polarization is determined by
topt =



√

∆ 2
(
−1 +
√

3∆ 2T 2
)
. (41)
Again by Taylor expansion, we could obtain
topt ≃ T
(
1 − ∆ 2T 2
24
)
. (42)

Based on this ﬁnding, it is shown that the optimal time
becomes longer asT increases and ∆ decreases, which
will be discussed in detail in the next section.
When the oscillation frequency of the external
magnetic ﬁeld matches the 129Xe Larmor frequency,
i.e., ∆ = 0, the time required to reach the maximum
transverse polarization istopt = T . It should be noted
that the optimal time should be smaller than T in
the non-resonance case, i.e., ∆ ̸= 0. The optimal
ampliﬁcation factors for the Markovian and QZE cases
are Π = 2λMnγnT e−1 [
26] and Π = 2 λMnγnT e−1/ 2,
respectively. Therefore, the QZE could enhance the
ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic ﬁeld by a factor√

FIG. 1. Time evolution of the transverse polarization P⊥
vs Bac for (a) the Gaussian and (b) the Markovian noise,
respectively. Solid lines represent the proﬁles under the l inear-
response approximation while symbols represent the proﬁle s
by the numerically-exact solution. The parameters T = 380 s
and ∆ = 2 . 5 mHz are used.
In the following, we will obtain the response of the
129Xe spins without the weak-ﬁeld approximation but
by solving Eqs. ( 23)-(25) numerically. Figure 1 shows
P⊥ against time in the QZE and Markovian case [ 26],
respectively. In order to verify the validity of the weak-
ﬁeld approximation, we compare the linear response with
the nonlinear response under diﬀerent amplitudes of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The approximated and the exact proﬁles
almost overlap with each other when the measured ﬁeld
is 10 pT. However, as the magnetic ﬁeld increases, their
diﬀerence becomes larger and larger, which suggests that
the approximation works well in the case of weak ﬁelds.
Most importantly, it is clearly observed that the response
in the former case is signiﬁcantly larger than that in the
latter, indicating that the magnetic ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed
more eﬀectively by the QZE.

Figure 2 compares the optimal response P opt

Markovian case and QZE regime over a wide range of
coherence times. It is shown that the optimal responses
in both cases exhibit the same trend, gradually increasing
withT . Furthermore, the response increases with the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld for a given coherence
timeT . Interestingly, it is evident that the responses in
the QZE consistently exceed those in the Markovian case.

FIG. 3. The optimal transverse polarization P opt
⊥ in (a) the
QZE and (b) the Markovian cases as a function of detuning
∆ for diﬀerentBacs. The other parameters are the same as
those used in Fig.
1.
In order to evaluate the eﬀect of the detuning ∆ on the
ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 3,
we compare the optimal responses under the QZE with
those in the Markovian case for diﬀerentBacs by solving
Eqs. (
23)-(25) numerically. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the
optimal response decreases monotonically with increasing
detuning for a ﬁxed value ofBac. Therefore, in order
5
to achieve a larger ampliﬁcation of the weak magnetic
ﬁeld, the resonance between the driving ﬁeld and Larmor
frequency is required. Furthermore, the optimal response
shows a gradual increase as the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is enhanced for a constant detuning. Since we employ
the QZE to amplify the weak magnetic ﬁeld, we further
investigate the optimal responses in the Markovian noise
in Fig.
3(b). For all Bacs, the optimal response is always
smaller than the counterparts in the QZE.

FIG. 4. Dependence of the optimal time topt on (a) the
relaxation time T with ∆ = 2 . 5 mHz and (b) the detuning ∆
with T = 380 s for the QZE in diﬀerent Bacs.
In Fig. 4, we present the optimal time topt to perform
the measurement as a function of the relaxation time
Tand detuning ∆ for the QZE, respectively. It is
demonstrated that topt is proportional to T for Bac =
10 pT, which is consistent with Eq. (
42). However,
as Bac increases, the time required to achieve the
optimal response decreases for a given T . On the
other hand, when talking about the dependence of the
optimal measurement time on ∆, it turns out to be
much complicated. It requires the longest time to
achieve the optimal response for the resonance case,
whiletopt decreases as the detuning is enlarged, which
is predicted by Eq. (
42). Notably, for diﬀerent magnetic
ﬁelds, all curves coincide with each other in the large-
detuning limit. These ﬁndings suggest that maximizing
the relaxation time while minimizing the detuning is
crucial for expediting the ampliﬁcation of the weak
magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, careful control of these parameters
is essential to enhance the eﬃciency and precision of the
measurement process.
Since in Fig.
3(a), the optimal responses increase as the
magnetic ﬁeld is enlarged, it may be quite natural to ask
whether there exists a bound for the optimal response.
As depicted in Fig.

INTRODUCTION\nAccording to astrophysical observations, roughly \ufb01ve\nsixths of the matter in the universe remains dark\n[\n1]. However, direct detection of its interactions with\nparticles and \ufb01elds of the standard model remains\nelusive [\n2]. There are a variety of particle candidates\nfor dark matter, such as quantum chromodynamics\naxion and axion-like particles (ALPs) [\n3], new Z\u2032\nbosons [ 4], new spin-1 bosons [ 5] and dark photons\n[6, 7]. Axions are prominent dark-matter and dark-\nenergy candidates, which are introduced as a compelling\nsolution to the strong-CP problem beyond the standard\nmodel. However, it is insu\ufb03cient to search for ALPs\nby traditional particle-physics techniques with light\nquanta such as the Large Hadron Collider [\n8, 9].\nTherefore, experimental searches for axion-like dark\nmatter are based on their non-gravitational interactions\nwith particles and \ufb01elds of the standard model [\n8\u201314].\nAs known to all, quantum ampli\ufb01cation plays\nan important role in quantum metrology and \ufb01nds\napplications in the measurements of weak \ufb01eld and\nforce [\n15\u201318], and optical ampli\ufb01cation [ 19] to search for\nnew physics beyond the standard model [ 10]. Besides,\nthe magnetic-\ufb01eld ampli\ufb01cation \ufb01nds applications in\na wide range of searching axion-nucleon interactions,\nsuch as ALPs and axion bursts from astrophysical\nevents [\n20, 21]. Under the state-of-art experiments,\nthe sensitivity has exceeded astrophysical limits [ 22] by\nseveral orders of magnitude. We note that both electron\n\u2217 aiqing@bnu.edu.cn\nand nuclear spins have shown great potential for realizing\nsignal ampli\ufb01cation. For example, the overlapping spin\nensemble, e.g.129Xe-87Rb, is used in self-compensating\ncomagnetometers [\n23\u201325]. Recently, the magnetic-\ufb01eld\nampli\ufb01cation using 129Xe noble gas overlapping with\nspin-polarized 87Rb atomic gas is demonstrated, which\nhas achieved a signi\ufb01cant improvement in ampli\ufb01cation\nof weak-\ufb01eld measurements under the Markovian noise,\ni.e., a constant spin relaxation rate [\n26].\nOn the other hand, the QZE describes the phenomenon\nthat a quantum system\u2019s dynamic evolution drastically\nslows down when measured frequently enough [\n27\u2013\n31]. The QZE plays a pivotal role in various domains\nof quantum science. One of the applications of the\nQZE is the quantum measurements, which can suppress\nthe detrimental e\ufb00ects of decoherence [\n32, 33]. By\nperforming frequent error-correction measurements, the\nQZE helps stabilize the quantum state of qubits, thereby\nprolonging their coherence time and enhancing the\nreliability of quantum computations. Both theoretically\nand experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the\nQZE can enhance the quantum metrology by using\nthe maximum-entangled states [\n34\u201336]. So far, the\nQZE has been experimentally observed in a number of\nphysical systems such as trapped ions [\n37, 38], ultracold\natoms [ 39\u201341], molecules [ 42], Bose-Einstein condensates\n[43], nitrogen-vacancy centers [ 44] and superconducting\nquantum circuits [ 45\u201348].\nTo achieve the more signi\ufb01cant ampli\ufb01cation of\nexternal magnetic \ufb01elds, in this paper, we propose a\nmagnetic-\ufb01eld ampli\ufb01cation using noble gas overlapping\nwith spin-polarized alkali-metal gas by the QZE, which\ncan achieve an improvement in the ampli\ufb01cation of\nweak-\ufb01eld measurements as compared to the Markovian\n2\ncase. In weak magnetic \ufb01elds, we obtain the\nanalytical solution to the dynamics of129Xe spins and\nampli\ufb01cation function, which present an enhancement\nofe1/ 2 compared to Markovian case. In the case of\nstrong magnetic \ufb01elds, we further examine the response\nof the129Xe spins by numerical simulations under\nvarious conditions. Then, we provide the optimal\nmeasurement parameters for the practical experiments,\ni.e., the detuning between the Larmor frequency and\nthe frequency of magnetic \ufb01eld, the decoherence time,\nand the magnitude of the magnetic \ufb01eld. We anticipate\nthat the present ampli\ufb01cation technique could stimulate\npossible applications in applied and fundamental physics.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The\nmodel is set up and the response of polarized 129Xe spins\nto a transverse oscillating magnetic \ufb01eld is derived in\nSec.\nII. Then, the response of polarized 129Xe spins in the\ncase of weak magnetic \ufb01elds is investigated in Sec. III. In\nSec. IV, the transverse polarization of the polarized 129Xe\nspins is studied and the optimal ampli\ufb01cation is explored\nin the case of strong magnetic \ufb01elds. A summary is\nconcluded in Sec.\nV.\nII. MODEL\nAccording to Ref. [ 49], there are two cells containing\nnuclear spins, i.e., the source and the sensor cells. In\norder to polarize the Rb spins and thus the129Xe nuclear\nspins, a static magnetic \ufb01eld with strength B0 is applied\nalong z-axis. Due to the axion-mediated interaction\nbetween polarized neutrons, the 129Xe nuclear spins are\nalso subject to a time-dependent transverse magnetic\n\ufb01eld. As a result, the129Xe nuclear spin in a magnetic\n\ufb01eld is described by the following Hamiltonian\n\u02c6H = \u2212\u03b3nB(t) \u00b7 \u02c6I, (1)\nwhere B(t) = B0 \u02c6z + Bac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6y is the total \ufb01eld\nexperienced by 129Xe nuclear spins with \u03bd being the\nLarmor frequency of the nuclear spins in the source cell,\n\u03b3n = 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 11.78 Hz/ \u00b5T [\n26] and \u02c6I = ( \u02c6Ix, \u02c6Iy, \u02c6Iz ) are the\ngyromagnetic ratio and the angular momentum operators\nof129Xe, respectively. Thus, the Larmor frequency of\n129Xe is\n\u03bd0 = \u03b3nB0\n2\u03c0 , (2)\nwhere \u03b3n is the gyromagnetic ratio of 129Xe. The spin\nHamiltonian with the total \ufb01eld reads explicitly\n\u02c6H = \u2212\u03b3nB0 \u02c6Iz \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6Iy. (3)\nAccording to the Heisenberg equation of motion, we\ncan obtain the dynamical equation for the nuclear spin\nangular momentum as\nd\u02c6Ix\ndt = \u03b3nB0 \u02c6Iy \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6Iz , (4)\nd\u02c6Iy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0 \u02c6Ix, (5)\nd\u02c6Iz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt) \u02c6Ix. (6)\nThe polarization of 129Xe atoms can be de\ufb01ned as\nP = \u27e8\u02c6I\u27e9\nv0\n, (7)\nwhere v\u22121\n0 is the atomic number density. The dynamics\nof the three polarization components can be described by\nthe Bloch equations as [\n50]\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz , (8)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px, (9)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px. (10)\nGenerally speaking, any quantum system inevitably\nsu\ufb00ers from the interaction with its environment. On\naccount of a Markovian noise, the dynamics of129Xe\nspins can be described with the Bloch equations\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz \u2212 1\nT2\nPx, (11)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px \u2212 1\nT2\nPy, (12)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px \u2212 1\nT1\nPz, (13)\nwhere T1 (T2) is the longitudinal (transverse) relaxation\ntime of 129Xe spin. We consider the response of polarized\n129Xe spins to a transverse oscillating magnetic \ufb01eld.\nConsidering a Gaussian noise, the dynamics of 129Xe\nspins can be described by the Bloch equation as [ 51]\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\nPx, (14)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\nPy, (15)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px \u2212 t\nT 2\n1\nPz . (16)\nTo analyze the system more conveniently, we transform\nit to the rotating frame de\ufb01ned by\n\u02c6U = ei2\u03c0\u03bdt \u02c6Iz . (17)\nIn the rotating frame, the e\ufb00ective Hamiltonian\n\u02c6\n\u02dcH = \u02c6U\u2020 \u02c6H \u02c6U \u2212 i \u02c6U\u2020 ddt\n\u02c6U (18)\n3\ncan be simpli\ufb01ed as\n\u02c6\n\u02dcH \u2248 \u2206 \u02c6Iz \u2212 12\u03b3nBac \u02c6Iy, (19)\nwhere \u2206 = 2 \u03c0(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0) is the detuning, and we have\ndropped the fast-oscillating terms by the rotating-wave\napproximation [\n30, 51]. Thus, the Bloch equations of\n129Xe spins in the rotating frame read\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\n\u02dcPx, (20)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\n\u02dcPy, (21)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n1\n\u02dcPz, (22)\nwhere \u02dcP\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z ) are the polarization of 129Xe spins\nin the rotating frame. According to Eq. ( 2), we can de\ufb01ne\nthe e\ufb00ective magnetic \ufb01eld in the rotating frame as \u02dcB =\n(Bac/2)\u02c6y \u2212 (\u2206 /\u03b3n)\u02c6z.\nWhen the Rb pump light is o\ufb00, the e\ufb00ective magnetic-\n\ufb01eld gradient induced by the Rb polarization is greatly\nsuppressed, resulting inT2 being close to T1 [\n49]. As a\nresult, we assume T2 \u2248 T1 = T and thus we have\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPx, (23)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPy, (24)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPz . (25)\nIII. LINEAR RESPONSE\nIn practical applications, precise measurement of weak\nmagnetic \ufb01elds is often of great interest, such as those\nassociated with precision medicine, deep-sea exploration\nand cardiac activity, etc [\n26]. When Bac is weak enough,\nwe can ignore the \ufb01rst term in Eq. ( 25). In this case,\nthe time evolution of \u02dcPz is decoupled with \u02dcPx, \u02dcPy and\nBac. And \u02dcPx exhibits a linear dependence on Bac.\nUnder the weak-\ufb01eld approximation, Eqs. ( 23)-(25) can\nbe simpli\ufb01ed as\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPx, (26)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPy, (27)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPz. (28)\nWhen the polarization is initially along z-axis, i.e., P(t =\n0) = (0 , 0, P0), the solutions to the above equations can\nbe expressed as follows\n\u02dcPx = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin(\u2206 t), (29)\n\u02dcPy = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [cos(\u2206 t) \u2212 1], (30)\n\u02dcPz = P0e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 . (31)\nSince the relation between the polarization in the\nrotating frame and the laboratory frame is\nPx(t) = \u02dcPx(t) cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 \u02dcPy(t) sin(\u03c9t), (32)\nPy(t) = \u02dcPx(t) sin(\u03c9t) + \u02dcPy(t) cos(\u03c9t), (33)\nPz(t) = \u02dcPz(t), (34)\nwe can obtain the polarization in the laboratory frame\nas\nPx = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [sin(\u2206 t \u2212 \u03c9t) + sin( \u03c9t)] , (35)\nPy = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [cos(\u2206 t \u2212 \u03c9t) \u2212 cos(\u03c9t)] , (36)\nPz = P0e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 . (37)\nThus, the magnitude of the transverse polarization can\nbe expressed as\nP\u22a5 = P0Bac\u03b3n\n\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\n. (38)\nAccording to Be\ufb00 = 8 \u03c0\u03ba0M0P\u22a5/3, where \u03ba0 = 540\ndenotes the Fermi-contact enhancement factor between\n129Xe and 87Rb [\n26, 52], the amplitude of the transverse\ne\ufb00ective \ufb01eld is\nBe\ufb00 = 8\u03c0\n3 \u03ba0M0\nP0Bac\u03b3n\n\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\n. (39)\nAnd thus the transverse \ufb01eld is ampli\ufb01ed by a factor\n\u03a0 \u2261 |Be\ufb00 |\n|Bac| = 2\u03bbMn\u03b3n\n\u2206 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\ne\u2212 t2\n2T 2 , (40)\nwhere Mn = M0P0 is the nuclear magnetization of\n129Xe, \u03bb = 4 \u03c0\u03ba0/3. The optimal time topt can be\nobtained by calculating \u2202\u03a0 /\u2202t|t=topt = 0, and thus\nyields tan (\u2206 topt/2) = \u2206 T 2/2topt. Now we expand\ntan(\u2206 topt/2) to the third order of \u2206 topt and obtain\nthe following expression (\u2206 topt/2) + (\u2206 topt/2)3 /3 =\n\u2206 T 2/2topt. The time required to reach the maximum\ntransverse polarization is determined by\ntopt =\n\ued6a\n\ued6b\n\ued6b\n\u221a\n6\n\u2206 2\n(\n\u22121 +\n\u221a\n1 + 1\n3\u2206 2T 2\n)\n. (41)\nAgain by Taylor expansion, we could obtain\ntopt \u2243 T\n(\n1 \u2212 \u2206 2T 2\n24\n)\n. (42)\n4\nBased on this \ufb01nding, it is shown that the optimal time\nbecomes longer asT increases and \u2206 decreases, which\nwill be discussed in detail in the next section.\nWhen the oscillation frequency of the external\nmagnetic \ufb01eld matches the 129Xe Larmor frequency,\ni.e., \u2206 = 0, the time required to reach the maximum\ntransverse polarization istopt = T . It should be noted\nthat the optimal time should be smaller than T in\nthe non-resonance case, i.e., \u2206 \u0338= 0. The optimal\nampli\ufb01cation factors for the Markovian and QZE cases\nare \u03a0 = 2\u03bbMn\u03b3nT e\u22121 [\n26] and \u03a0 = 2 \u03bbMn\u03b3nT e\u22121/ 2,\nrespectively. Therefore, the QZE could enhance the\nampli\ufb01cation of the weak magnetic \ufb01eld by a factor\u221a\ne.\nIV.

In order to verify the validity of the weak-\n\ufb01eld approximation, we compare the linear response with\nthe nonlinear response under di\ufb00erent amplitudes of the\nmagnetic \ufb01eld. The approximated and the exact pro\ufb01les\nalmost overlap with each other when the measured \ufb01eld\nis 10 pT. However, as the magnetic \ufb01eld increases, their\ndi\ufb00erence becomes larger and larger, which suggests that\nthe approximation works well in the case of weak \ufb01elds.\nMost importantly, it is clearly observed that the response\nin the former case is signi\ufb01cantly larger than that in the\nlatter, indicating that the magnetic \ufb01eld can be ampli\ufb01ed\nmore e\ufb00ectively by the QZE.\n/s48 /s50/s48/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48/s48\n/s48/s46/s48\n/s48/s46/s49\n/s48/s46/s50\n/s48/s46/s51\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s81/s90/s69/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s77/s97/s114/s107/s111/s118/s105/s97/s110/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s80\n/s94\n/s111/s112/s116\n/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41\n/s84 /s32/s40/s115/s41\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s49/s48/s112/s84 /s50/s48/s112/s84 /s51/s48/s112/s84 /s52/s48/s112/s84\nFIG. 2.

The optimal transverse polarization P opt\n\u22a5 in (a) the\nQZE and (b) the Markovian cases as a function of detuning\n\u2206 for di\ufb00erentBacs.

(\n23)-(25) numerically. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the\noptimal response decreases monotonically with increasing\ndetuning for a \ufb01xed value ofBac. Therefore, in order\n5\nto achieve a larger ampli\ufb01cation of the weak magnetic\n\ufb01eld, the resonance between the driving \ufb01eld and Larmor\nfrequency is required. Furthermore, the optimal response\nshows a gradual increase as the magnetic \ufb01eld strength\nis enhanced for a constant detuning. Since we employ\nthe QZE to amplify the weak magnetic \ufb01eld, we further\ninvestigate the optimal responses in the Markovian noise\nin Fig.\n3(b). For all Bacs, the optimal response is always\nsmaller than the counterparts in the QZE.\n/s48 /s50/s53/s48 /s53/s48/s48\n/s48\n/s49/s48/s48\n/s50/s48/s48\n/s51/s48/s48\n/s52/s48/s48\n/s53/s48/s48\n/s48/s46/s48\n/s48\n/s49/s48/s48\n/s50/s48/s48\n/s51/s48/s48\n/s52/s48/s48\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s116\n/s111/s112/s116\n/s32/s40/s115/s41\n/s84/s32 /s40/s115/s41\n/s40/s97/s41\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s40/s98/s41\n/s68 /s32 /s40/s72/s122/s41\nFIG. 4. Dependence of the optimal time topt on (a) the\nrelaxation time T with \u2206 = 2 . 5 mHz and (b) the detuning \u2206\nwith T = 380 s for the QZE in di\ufb00erent Bacs.\nIn Fig. 4, we present the optimal time topt to perform\nthe measurement as a function of the relaxation time\nTand detuning \u2206 for the QZE, respectively. It is\ndemonstrated that topt is proportional to T for Bac =\n10 pT, which is consistent with Eq. (\n42). However,\nas Bac increases, the time required to achieve the\noptimal response decreases for a given T . On the\nother hand, when talking about the dependence of the\noptimal measurement time on \u2206, it turns out to be\nmuch complicated. It requires the longest time to\nachieve the optimal response for the resonance case,\nwhiletopt decreases as the detuning is enlarged, which\nis predicted by Eq. (\n42). Notably, for di\ufb00erent magnetic\n\ufb01elds, all curves coincide with each other in the large-\ndetuning limit. These \ufb01ndings suggest that maximizing\nthe relaxation time while minimizing the detuning is\ncrucial for expediting the ampli\ufb01cation of the weak\nmagnetic \ufb01eld. Thus, careful control of these parameters\nis essential to enhance the e\ufb03ciency and precision of the\nmeasurement process.\nSince in Fig.\n3(a), the optimal responses increase as the\nmagnetic \ufb01eld is enlarged, it may be quite natural to ask\nwhether there exists a bound for the optimal response.\nAs depicted in Fig.\n5, we explore the optimal response\nfor di\ufb00erent sets of ( Bac, \u2206).

INTRODUCTION\nAccording to astrophysical observations, roughly \ufb01ve\nsixths of the matter in the universe remains dark\n[\n1]. However, direct detection of its interactions with\nparticles and \ufb01elds of the standard model remains\nelusive [\n2]. There are a variety of particle candidates\nfor dark matter, such as quantum chromodynamics\naxion and axion-like particles (ALPs) [\n3], new Z\u2032\nbosons [ 4], new spin-1 bosons [ 5] and dark photons\n[6, 7]. Axions are prominent dark-matter and dark-\nenergy candidates, which are introduced as a compelling\nsolution to the strong-CP problem beyond the standard\nmodel. However, it is insu\ufb03cient to search for ALPs\nby traditional particle-physics techniques with light\nquanta such as the Large Hadron Collider [\n8, 9].\nTherefore, experimental searches for axion-like dark\nmatter are based on their non-gravitational interactions\nwith particles and \ufb01elds of the standard model [\n8\u201314].\nAs known to all, quantum ampli\ufb01cation plays\nan important role in quantum metrology and \ufb01nds\napplications in the measurements of weak \ufb01eld and\nforce [\n15\u201318], and optical ampli\ufb01cation [ 19] to search for\nnew physics beyond the standard model [ 10]. Besides,\nthe magnetic-\ufb01eld ampli\ufb01cation \ufb01nds applications in\na wide range of searching axion-nucleon interactions,\nsuch as ALPs and axion bursts from astrophysical\nevents [\n20, 21]. Under the state-of-art experiments,\nthe sensitivity has exceeded astrophysical limits [ 22] by\nseveral orders of magnitude. We note that both electron\n\u2217 aiqing@bnu.edu.cn\nand nuclear spins have shown great potential for realizing\nsignal ampli\ufb01cation. For example, the overlapping spin\nensemble, e.g.129Xe-87Rb, is used in self-compensating\ncomagnetometers [\n23\u201325]. Recently, the magnetic-\ufb01eld\nampli\ufb01cation using 129Xe noble gas overlapping with\nspin-polarized 87Rb atomic gas is demonstrated, which\nhas achieved a signi\ufb01cant improvement in ampli\ufb01cation\nof weak-\ufb01eld measurements under the Markovian noise,\ni.e., a constant spin relaxation rate [\n26].\nOn the other hand, the QZE describes the phenomenon\nthat a quantum system\u2019s dynamic evolution drastically\nslows down when measured frequently enough [\n27\u2013\n31]. The QZE plays a pivotal role in various domains\nof quantum science. One of the applications of the\nQZE is the quantum measurements, which can suppress\nthe detrimental e\ufb00ects of decoherence [\n32, 33]. By\nperforming frequent error-correction measurements, the\nQZE helps stabilize the quantum state of qubits, thereby\nprolonging their coherence time and enhancing the\nreliability of quantum computations. Both theoretically\nand experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the\nQZE can enhance the quantum metrology by using\nthe maximum-entangled states [\n34\u201336]. So far, the\nQZE has been experimentally observed in a number of\nphysical systems such as trapped ions [\n37, 38], ultracold\natoms [ 39\u201341], molecules [ 42], Bose-Einstein condensates\n[43], nitrogen-vacancy centers [ 44] and superconducting\nquantum circuits [ 45\u201348].\nTo achieve the more signi\ufb01cant ampli\ufb01cation of\nexternal magnetic \ufb01elds, in this paper, we propose a\nmagnetic-\ufb01eld ampli\ufb01cation using noble gas overlapping\nwith spin-polarized alkali-metal gas by the QZE, which\ncan achieve an improvement in the ampli\ufb01cation of\nweak-\ufb01eld measurements as compared to the Markovian\n2\ncase. In weak magnetic \ufb01elds, we obtain the\nanalytical solution to the dynamics of129Xe spins and\nampli\ufb01cation function, which present an enhancement\nofe1/ 2 compared to Markovian case. In the case of\nstrong magnetic \ufb01elds, we further examine the response\nof the129Xe spins by numerical simulations under\nvarious conditions. Then, we provide the optimal\nmeasurement parameters for the practical experiments,\ni.e., the detuning between the Larmor frequency and\nthe frequency of magnetic \ufb01eld, the decoherence time,\nand the magnitude of the magnetic \ufb01eld. We anticipate\nthat the present ampli\ufb01cation technique could stimulate\npossible applications in applied and fundamental physics.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The\nmodel is set up and the response of polarized 129Xe spins\nto a transverse oscillating magnetic \ufb01eld is derived in\nSec.\nII. Then, the response of polarized 129Xe spins in the\ncase of weak magnetic \ufb01elds is investigated in Sec. III. In\nSec. IV, the transverse polarization of the polarized 129Xe\nspins is studied and the optimal ampli\ufb01cation is explored\nin the case of strong magnetic \ufb01elds. A summary is\nconcluded in Sec.\nV.\nII. MODEL\nAccording to Ref. [ 49], there are two cells containing\nnuclear spins, i.e., the source and the sensor cells. In\norder to polarize the Rb spins and thus the129Xe nuclear\nspins, a static magnetic \ufb01eld with strength B0 is applied\nalong z-axis. Due to the axion-mediated interaction\nbetween polarized neutrons, the 129Xe nuclear spins are\nalso subject to a time-dependent transverse magnetic\n\ufb01eld. As a result, the129Xe nuclear spin in a magnetic\n\ufb01eld is described by the following Hamiltonian\n\u02c6H = \u2212\u03b3nB(t) \u00b7 \u02c6I, (1)\nwhere B(t) = B0 \u02c6z + Bac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6y is the total \ufb01eld\nexperienced by 129Xe nuclear spins with \u03bd being the\nLarmor frequency of the nuclear spins in the source cell,\n\u03b3n = 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 11.78 Hz/ \u00b5T [\n26] and \u02c6I = ( \u02c6Ix, \u02c6Iy, \u02c6Iz ) are the\ngyromagnetic ratio and the angular momentum operators\nof129Xe, respectively. Thus, the Larmor frequency of\n129Xe is\n\u03bd0 = \u03b3nB0\n2\u03c0 , (2)\nwhere \u03b3n is the gyromagnetic ratio of 129Xe. The spin\nHamiltonian with the total \ufb01eld reads explicitly\n\u02c6H = \u2212\u03b3nB0 \u02c6Iz \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6Iy. (3)\nAccording to the Heisenberg equation of motion, we\ncan obtain the dynamical equation for the nuclear spin\nangular momentum as\nd\u02c6Ix\ndt = \u03b3nB0 \u02c6Iy \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)\u02c6Iz , (4)\nd\u02c6Iy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0 \u02c6Ix, (5)\nd\u02c6Iz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt) \u02c6Ix. (6)\nThe polarization of 129Xe atoms can be de\ufb01ned as\nP = \u27e8\u02c6I\u27e9\nv0\n, (7)\nwhere v\u22121\n0 is the atomic number density. The dynamics\nof the three polarization components can be described by\nthe Bloch equations as [\n50]\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz , (8)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px, (9)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px. (10)\nGenerally speaking, any quantum system inevitably\nsu\ufb00ers from the interaction with its environment. On\naccount of a Markovian noise, the dynamics of129Xe\nspins can be described with the Bloch equations\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz \u2212 1\nT2\nPx, (11)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px \u2212 1\nT2\nPy, (12)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px \u2212 1\nT1\nPz, (13)\nwhere T1 (T2) is the longitudinal (transverse) relaxation\ntime of 129Xe spin. We consider the response of polarized\n129Xe spins to a transverse oscillating magnetic \ufb01eld.\nConsidering a Gaussian noise, the dynamics of 129Xe\nspins can be described by the Bloch equation as [ 51]\ndPx\ndt = \u03b3nB0Py \u2212 \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Pz \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\nPx, (14)\ndPy\ndt = \u2212\u03b3nB0Px \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\nPy, (15)\ndPz\ndt = \u03b3nBac cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt)Px \u2212 t\nT 2\n1\nPz . (16)\nTo analyze the system more conveniently, we transform\nit to the rotating frame de\ufb01ned by\n\u02c6U = ei2\u03c0\u03bdt \u02c6Iz . (17)\nIn the rotating frame, the e\ufb00ective Hamiltonian\n\u02c6\n\u02dcH = \u02c6U\u2020 \u02c6H \u02c6U \u2212 i \u02c6U\u2020 ddt\n\u02c6U (18)\n3\ncan be simpli\ufb01ed as\n\u02c6\n\u02dcH \u2248 \u2206 \u02c6Iz \u2212 12\u03b3nBac \u02c6Iy, (19)\nwhere \u2206 = 2 \u03c0(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0) is the detuning, and we have\ndropped the fast-oscillating terms by the rotating-wave\napproximation [\n30, 51]. Thus, the Bloch equations of\n129Xe spins in the rotating frame read\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\n\u02dcPx, (20)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n2\n\u02dcPy, (21)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n1\n\u02dcPz, (22)\nwhere \u02dcP\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z ) are the polarization of 129Xe spins\nin the rotating frame. According to Eq. ( 2), we can de\ufb01ne\nthe e\ufb00ective magnetic \ufb01eld in the rotating frame as \u02dcB =\n(Bac/2)\u02c6y \u2212 (\u2206 /\u03b3n)\u02c6z.\nWhen the Rb pump light is o\ufb00, the e\ufb00ective magnetic-\n\ufb01eld gradient induced by the Rb polarization is greatly\nsuppressed, resulting inT2 being close to T1 [\n49]. As a\nresult, we assume T2 \u2248 T1 = T and thus we have\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPx, (23)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPy, (24)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPz . (25)\nIII. LINEAR RESPONSE\nIn practical applications, precise measurement of weak\nmagnetic \ufb01elds is often of great interest, such as those\nassociated with precision medicine, deep-sea exploration\nand cardiac activity, etc [\n26]. When Bac is weak enough,\nwe can ignore the \ufb01rst term in Eq. ( 25). In this case,\nthe time evolution of \u02dcPz is decoupled with \u02dcPx, \u02dcPy and\nBac. And \u02dcPx exhibits a linear dependence on Bac.\nUnder the weak-\ufb01eld approximation, Eqs. ( 23)-(25) can\nbe simpli\ufb01ed as\n\u02d9\u02dcPx = \u03b3nBac\n2\n\u02dcPz + \u2206 \u02dcPy \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPx, (26)\n\u02d9\u02dcPy = \u2212\u2206 \u02dcPx \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPy, (27)\n\u02d9\u02dcPz = \u2212 t\nT 2\n\u02dcPz. (28)\nWhen the polarization is initially along z-axis, i.e., P(t =\n0) = (0 , 0, P0), the solutions to the above equations can\nbe expressed as follows\n\u02dcPx = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin(\u2206 t), (29)\n\u02dcPy = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [cos(\u2206 t) \u2212 1], (30)\n\u02dcPz = P0e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 . (31)\nSince the relation between the polarization in the\nrotating frame and the laboratory frame is\nPx(t) = \u02dcPx(t) cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 \u02dcPy(t) sin(\u03c9t), (32)\nPy(t) = \u02dcPx(t) sin(\u03c9t) + \u02dcPy(t) cos(\u03c9t), (33)\nPz(t) = \u02dcPz(t), (34)\nwe can obtain the polarization in the laboratory frame\nas\nPx = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [sin(\u2206 t \u2212 \u03c9t) + sin( \u03c9t)] , (35)\nPy = P0Bac\u03b3n\n2\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 [cos(\u2206 t \u2212 \u03c9t) \u2212 cos(\u03c9t)] , (36)\nPz = P0e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 . (37)\nThus, the magnitude of the transverse polarization can\nbe expressed as\nP\u22a5 = P0Bac\u03b3n\n\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\n. (38)\nAccording to Be\ufb00 = 8 \u03c0\u03ba0M0P\u22a5/3, where \u03ba0 = 540\ndenotes the Fermi-contact enhancement factor between\n129Xe and 87Rb [\n26, 52], the amplitude of the transverse\ne\ufb00ective \ufb01eld is\nBe\ufb00 = 8\u03c0\n3 \u03ba0M0\nP0Bac\u03b3n\n\u2206 e\u2212 t2\n2T 2 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\n. (39)\nAnd thus the transverse \ufb01eld is ampli\ufb01ed by a factor\n\u03a0 \u2261 |Be\ufb00 |\n|Bac| = 2\u03bbMn\u03b3n\n\u2206 sin\n( \u2206 t\n2\n)\ne\u2212 t2\n2T 2 , (40)\nwhere Mn = M0P0 is the nuclear magnetization of\n129Xe, \u03bb = 4 \u03c0\u03ba0/3. The optimal time topt can be\nobtained by calculating \u2202\u03a0 /\u2202t|t=topt = 0, and thus\nyields tan (\u2206 topt/2) = \u2206 T 2/2topt. Now we expand\ntan(\u2206 topt/2) to the third order of \u2206 topt and obtain\nthe following expression (\u2206 topt/2) + (\u2206 topt/2)3 /3 =\n\u2206 T 2/2topt. The time required to reach the maximum\ntransverse polarization is determined by\ntopt =\n\ued6a\n\ued6b\n\ued6b\n\u221a\n6\n\u2206 2\n(\n\u22121 +\n\u221a\n1 + 1\n3\u2206 2T 2\n)\n. (41)\nAgain by Taylor expansion, we could obtain\ntopt \u2243 T\n(\n1 \u2212 \u2206 2T 2\n24\n)\n. (42)\n4\nBased on this \ufb01nding, it is shown that the optimal time\nbecomes longer asT increases and \u2206 decreases, which\nwill be discussed in detail in the next section.\nWhen the oscillation frequency of the external\nmagnetic \ufb01eld matches the 129Xe Larmor frequency,\ni.e., \u2206 = 0, the time required to reach the maximum\ntransverse polarization istopt = T . It should be noted\nthat the optimal time should be smaller than T in\nthe non-resonance case, i.e., \u2206 \u0338= 0. The optimal\nampli\ufb01cation factors for the Markovian and QZE cases\nare \u03a0 = 2\u03bbMn\u03b3nT e\u22121 [\n26] and \u03a0 = 2 \u03bbMn\u03b3nT e\u22121/ 2,\nrespectively. Therefore, the QZE could enhance the\nampli\ufb01cation of the weak magnetic \ufb01eld by a factor\u221a\ne.\nIV.

Time evolution of the transverse polarization P\u22a5\nvs Bac for (a) the Gaussian and (b) the Markovian noise,\nrespectively. Solid lines represent the pro\ufb01les under the l inear-\nresponse approximation while symbols represent the pro\ufb01le s\nby the numerically-exact solution. The parameters T = 380 s\nand \u2206 = 2 . 5 mHz are used.\nIn the following, we will obtain the response of the\n129Xe spins without the weak-\ufb01eld approximation but\nby solving Eqs. ( 23)-(25) numerically. Figure 1 shows\nP\u22a5 against time in the QZE and Markovian case [ 26],\nrespectively. In order to verify the validity of the weak-\n\ufb01eld approximation, we compare the linear response with\nthe nonlinear response under di\ufb00erent amplitudes of the\nmagnetic \ufb01eld. The approximated and the exact pro\ufb01les\nalmost overlap with each other when the measured \ufb01eld\nis 10 pT. However, as the magnetic \ufb01eld increases, their\ndi\ufb00erence becomes larger and larger, which suggests that\nthe approximation works well in the case of weak \ufb01elds.\nMost importantly, it is clearly observed that the response\nin the former case is signi\ufb01cantly larger than that in the\nlatter, indicating that the magnetic \ufb01eld can be ampli\ufb01ed\nmore e\ufb00ectively by the QZE.\n/s48 /s50/s48/s48/s48 /s52/s48/s48/s48\n/s48/s46/s48\n/s48/s46/s49\n/s48/s46/s50\n/s48/s46/s51\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s81/s90/s69/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s77/s97/s114/s107/s111/s118/s105/s97/s110/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s80\n/s94\n/s111/s112/s116\n/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41\n/s84 /s32/s40/s115/s41\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32 /s32/s32/s32/s32/s32/s32\n/s49/s48/s112/s84 /s50/s48/s112/s84 /s51/s48/s112/s84 /s52/s48/s112/s84\nFIG. 2.

The other parameters are\nthe same as those used in Fig.\n1.\nFigure 2 compares the optimal response P opt\n\u22a5 in the\nMarkovian case and QZE regime over a wide range of\ncoherence times. It is shown that the optimal responses\nin both cases exhibit the same trend, gradually increasing\nwithT . Furthermore, the response increases with the\nmagnitude of the magnetic \ufb01eld for a given coherence\ntimeT . Interestingly, it is evident that the responses in\nthe QZE consistently exceed those in the Markovian case.\n/s45/s48/s46/s52 /s45/s48/s46/s50 /s48/s46/s48 /s48/s46/s50 /s48/s46/s52\n/s48/s46/s48/s48\n/s48/s46/s48/s53\n/s48/s46/s49/s48\n/s48/s46/s49/s53\n/s48/s46/s50/s48\n/s45/s48/s46/s52 /s45/s48/s46/s50 /s48/s46/s48 /s48/s46/s50 /s48/s46/s52\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s68/s32/s40 /s72/s122 /s41\n/s68/s32/s40 /s72/s122 /s41\n/s80\n/s94\n/s111/s112/s116\n/s32/s40/s97/s46/s117/s46/s41\n/s40/s97/s41\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84/s32\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s40/s98/s41\nFIG. 3.

(\n23)-(25) numerically. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the\noptimal response decreases monotonically with increasing\ndetuning for a \ufb01xed value ofBac. Therefore, in order\n5\nto achieve a larger ampli\ufb01cation of the weak magnetic\n\ufb01eld, the resonance between the driving \ufb01eld and Larmor\nfrequency is required. Furthermore, the optimal response\nshows a gradual increase as the magnetic \ufb01eld strength\nis enhanced for a constant detuning. Since we employ\nthe QZE to amplify the weak magnetic \ufb01eld, we further\ninvestigate the optimal responses in the Markovian noise\nin Fig.\n3(b). For all Bacs, the optimal response is always\nsmaller than the counterparts in the QZE.\n/s48 /s50/s53/s48 /s53/s48/s48\n/s48\n/s49/s48/s48\n/s50/s48/s48\n/s51/s48/s48\n/s52/s48/s48\n/s53/s48/s48\n/s48/s46/s48\n/s48\n/s49/s48/s48\n/s50/s48/s48\n/s51/s48/s48\n/s52/s48/s48\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s116\n/s111/s112/s116\n/s32/s40/s115/s41\n/s84/s32 /s40/s115/s41\n/s40/s97/s41\n/s32/s49/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s52/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s56/s48/s112/s84\n/s32/s49/s48/s48/s112/s84\n/s40/s98/s41\n/s68 /s32 /s40/s72/s122/s41\nFIG. 4. Dependence of the optimal time topt on (a) the\nrelaxation time T with \u2206 = 2 . 5 mHz and (b) the detuning \u2206\nwith T = 380 s for the QZE in di\ufb00erent Bacs.\nIn Fig. 4, we present the optimal time topt to perform\nthe measurement as a function of the relaxation time\nTand detuning \u2206 for the QZE, respectively. It is\ndemonstrated that topt is proportional to T for Bac =\n10 pT, which is consistent with Eq. (\n42). However,\nas Bac increases, the time required to achieve the\noptimal response decreases for a given T . On the\nother hand, when talking about the dependence of the\noptimal measurement time on \u2206, it turns out to be\nmuch complicated. It requires the longest time to\nachieve the optimal response for the resonance case,\nwhiletopt decreases as the detuning is enlarged, which\nis predicted by Eq. (\n42). Notably, for di\ufb00erent magnetic\n\ufb01elds, all curves coincide with each other in the large-\ndetuning limit. These \ufb01ndings suggest that maximizing\nthe relaxation time while minimizing the detuning is\ncrucial for expediting the ampli\ufb01cation of the weak\nmagnetic \ufb01eld. Thus, careful control of these parameters\nis essential to enhance the e\ufb03ciency and precision of the\nmeasurement process.\nSince in Fig.\n3(a), the optimal responses increase as the\nmagnetic \ufb01eld is enlarged, it may be quite natural to ask\nwhether there exists a bound for the optimal response.\nAs depicted in Fig.\n5, we explore the optimal response\nfor di\ufb00erent sets of ( Bac, \u2206).

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). \nstudies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: \u2022 Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. \u2022 In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering \nA Machine Learning-Based Method for Identifying Critical Distance Relays for Transient Stability Studies Ramin Vakili, Student Member, IEEE, and Mojdeh Khorsand, Member, IEEE \nT \n 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software\u2014a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays\u2014has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability \nstudies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  \u2022 Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  \u2022 Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. \u2022 The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold \n 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  \u2022 Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  \u2022 Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  \n Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. \n\n 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]\n            "

THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]\n            "

  Abstract—Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability studies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power systems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE positive sequence load flow analysis (PSLF) software is used to perform stability studies. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The results also show that only modeling the identified critical distance relays suffices to perform accurate stability studies.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE positive sequence load flow analysis (PSLF) software is used to perform stability studies. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). \nstudies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: \u2022 Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. \u2022 In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering \nA Machine Learning-Based Method for Identifying Critical Distance Relays for Transient Stability Studies Ramin Vakili, Student Member, IEEE, and Mojdeh Khorsand, Member, IEEE \nT \n 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software\u2014a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays\u2014has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability \nstudies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  \u2022 Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  \u2022 Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. \u2022 The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold \n 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  \u2022 Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  \u2022 Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  \n Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. \n\n 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]\n            "

The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored.

IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  \u2022 Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  \u2022 Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  \n Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. \n\n 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this pape... [content truncated]\n            "

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering

T 
 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

  for Transient Stability Studies
            Authors: Ramin Vakili and Mojdeh Khorsand
            Abstract:   Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability
studies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power
systems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of
stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the
settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the
protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays
are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in
current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine
learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability
studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in
those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE

  Abstract—Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability studies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power systems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE positive sequence load flow analysis (PSLF) software is used to perform stability studies. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The results also show that only modeling the identified critical distance relays suffices to perform accurate stability studies.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3].

Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: \u2022 Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. \u2022 In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering \nA Machine Learning-Based Method for Identifying Critical Distance Relays for Transient Stability Studies Ramin Vakili, Student Member, IEEE, and Mojdeh Khorsand, Member, IEEE \nT \n 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software\u2014a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays\u2014has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability \nstudies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  \u2022 Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  \u2022 Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. \u2022 The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold \n 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  \u2022 Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  \u2022 Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  \n Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. \n\n 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, \nthat the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59=\t!\"!\"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b=\t!\"!\"#$\" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid \n 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, \u201cZlin1\u201d and \u201cZlinw\u201d. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV \u2013 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known \u201cscikit-learn\u201d library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum \ndepth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the \u201cscikit-learn\u201d library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, \u201c0:1, 1:10\u201d means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The \u201cbalanced\u201d weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the \u201cbalanced\u201d option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). \nstudies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: \u2022 Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. \u2022 In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering \nA Machine Learning-Based Method for Identifying Critical Distance Relays for Transient Stability Studies Ramin Vakili, Student Member, IEEE, and Mojdeh Khorsand, Member, IEEE \nT \n 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software\u2014a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays\u2014has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability \nstudies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  \u2022 Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  \u2022 Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. \u2022 The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold \n 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  \u2022 Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  \u2022 Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  \n Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. \n\n 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: \u2022 One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. \u2022 The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. \u2022 The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, \nthat the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59=\t!\"!\"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b=\t!\"!\"#$\" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid \n 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, \u201cZlin1\u201d and \u201cZlinw\u201d. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV \u2013 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known \u201cscikit-learn\u201d library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum \ndepth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the \u201cscikit-learn\u201d library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, \u201c0:1, 1:10\u201d means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The \u201cbalanced\u201d weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the \u201cbalanced\u201d option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method.

After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast.

Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays.

Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the

In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

The paper also explains the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including Recall and Precision. The paper provides a two-stage grid search method to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to assess the performances of the trained models.

The paper also provides a case study on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

I hope this summary and additional information are helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.[0m

  for Transient Stability Studies
            Authors: Ramin Vakili and Mojdeh Khorsand
            Abstract:   Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability
studies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power
systems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of
stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the
settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the
protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays
are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in
current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine
learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability
studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in
those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE
positive sequence load flow analysis (PSLF) software is used to perform
stability studies. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity
Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load
under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results
show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance
relays. The results also show that only modeling the identified critical
distance relays suffices to perform accurate stability studies.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.

The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency.

Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering

T 
 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the

In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

**Summary of the Paper**

The paper proposes a machine learning-based method for identifying critical distance relays for transient stability studies. The method uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system and is less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems.

The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

**Additional Information**

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the random forest algorithm and its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations. The paper also explains the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including Recall and Precision. The paper provides a two-stage grid search method to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to assess the performances of the trained models.

  Abstract—Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability studies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power systems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of stability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the settings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the protective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays are among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in current practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies.

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.  A link between the power system simulator for engineering

T 
 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

I.  INTRODUCTION he dynamic responses of the major assets in power systems including generators, loads, and control systems along with the responses of the protection schemes are the two main aspects that define power system behavior during major disturbances [1]. Post-analysis of many of the prior blackouts and major outages show that unforeseen relay misoperations played a significant role in leading the system toward these catastrophic events [2], [3]. In this regard, protection systems are identified by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as critical reliability assets in power systems [4]. Therefore, proper modeling of protection systems in transient stability studies is crucial for obtaining a realistic assessment of system behavior [5]. There are different types of protective relays in bulk power systems that are needed to be included in transient stability  The authors are with the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706 USA (e-mail: rvakili@asu.edu; mojdeh.khorsand@asu.edu). 
studies to achieve a realistic assessment of system behavior. Some of these protective relays, such as underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) and undervoltage load shedding (UVLS) relays, usually are included in transient stability studies. However, despite being one of the most common and critical protective relays in power systems, distance relays are usually not properly included in stability studies [5]. References [4]-[8] show that the results of transient stability studies performed without modeling distance relays might not capture the actual response of the system to a disturbance. This paper also shows the importance of modeling distance relays in stability studies with further case studies on the WECC system. The most straightforward way to capture the behavior of distance relays in transient stability studies is to model all the relays in the system. However, modeling thousands of distance relays that exist in bulk power systems, such as the WECC system, is challenging due to two main reasons [6]: • Commercial stability software tools, such as GE PSLF, have limitations on the number of dynamic models that can be included in the dynamic files used for stability studies. Therefore, modeling thousands of distance relays in a bulk power system overwhelms the dynamic file and exceeds the current limitation of the software. • In bulk power systems, it is a challenging task to keep the updated setting information of thousands of distance relays in the dynamic file of the system since protection engineers change these settings for various purposes. The reach of the operation zones and the time delay for the operation of each zone are the two main settings that govern the functionality of distance relays. In an outdated dynamic file, the settings of one or more distance relays can be different from their actual values. It is shown in [6] that outdated relay settings might lead to an incorrect assessment of the dynamic behavior of power systems during major disturbances. Due to these challenges, the need for a method to identify the critical distance relays for each type of contingency, i.e., the distance relays that are likely to operate during the contingency, has been identified by the industry [3], [5], and [9]. To address this need, various methods are proposed in the literature to identify the critical distance relays that are required to be included in transient stability studies.

 2 (PSS/E) and the computer-aided protection engineering (CAPE) software—a software tool for analyzing the behavior of protective relays—has been developed in [10]. The link developed in [10] provides a platform for simultaneous assessment of protection system behavior and dynamic response of power systems during disturbances. During severe disturbances, the initiating event might have system-wide impacts and results in unstable power swings that can cause misoperations of several distance relays in the system at locations far from the initial fault location [9].  However, using the approach of [10], only the operations of the distance relays in the vicinity of initial fault locations are analyzed and the system-wide effects of disturbances on the distance relays are ignored. References [7], [11], and [12] have proposed different methods for identifying critical distance relays. The methods proposed in these references are based on the location and size of the initiating events. Therefore, these methods also fail to identify the distance relays which operate due to the system-wide effects of the initiating events.  As another method of identifying critical distance relays, the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England monitors the impedance trajectories observed by relays in their planning studies. If any of the impedance trajectories traverse into the zone-3 reach of its related distance relay, which is considered 300% of line impedances for all the transmission lines in this initial study, the actual setting data of the relay is collected, and the relay is modeled in the planning studies [13]. The operation of distance relays affects the system behavior assessment for the remainder of the simulation. Therefore, after identifying the distance relay that operates first during the transient stability study, the results of the study might not properly reflect the actual behavior of the system for the remainder of the simulation. Hence, the rest of the critical distance relays identified by this method might be incorrect.  References [14] and [15] have proposed new methods for identifying the distance relays that are at the electrical center of a system and might misoperate due to unstable power swings during out-of-step (OOS) conditions. A generic method for identifying the critical distance relays for all types of contingencies is proposed in [5], which is based on solving an optimization problem using the prior generator grouping information and network structure. However, the methods proposed in [14], [15], and [5] only focus on the distance relay operations that occur due to unstable power swings. Thus, they do not consider the operations in the vicinity of the initiating event, which occur due to the initial impacts of the event. Moreover, the method in [5] provides a generic list of critical distance relays for all types of contingencies. However, the type and location of a contingency significantly affect the list of the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled for performing an accurate transient stability study. Therefore, providing a specific list of critical distance relays for each contingency is of great importance.  Different methods for designing distance relay schemes are proposed in [16]-[25] which enables these schemes to distinguish between a power swing and a fault condition. If these schemes are properly modeled in transient stability 
studies, they might be able to detect distance relay misoperations due to unstable power swings and OOS conditions. Nevertheless, none of these methods are able to identify all the critical distance relays which are required to be modeled for performing accurate transient stability studies.  The method proposed in [6] is an iterative algorithm that utilizes two methods of apparent impedance monitoring and minimum voltage evaluation to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency. Although this method can identify all the critical distance relays for a contingency, it imposes a heavy computational burden as several runs of transient stability studies should be performed in this method. This, in turn, leads to excessive simulation time.  A fast machine learning (ML)-based method is proposed in this paper that eliminates the drawbacks of the methods in the literature. The method trains an ML model which promptly identifies all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. To train the model, the method utilizes the results of extensive offline transient stability studies of different types of contingencies under various operating conditions and topologies of the system. After being trained, the model uses the results of an initial early-terminated transient stability study of the contingency under study to identify the critical distance relays for that contingency. The number of critical distance relays identified by the method for any contingency is far less than the total number of distance relays in the system. Therefore, the method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system. Moreover, it is indeed less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems. The major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:  • Unlike the methods proposed in the literature, the ML-based method developed in this paper is able to identify all the critical distance relays that are required to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. This includes the distance relays that operate due to the initial impacts of the contingency and the ones that operate due to the system-wide impacts of the contingency.  • Unlike the other methods in the literature, the proposed method is very fast. Therefore, it can be used in planning studies, where a sheer number of contingencies are studied, to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study. • The proposed method is trained considering different operating conditions and topologies of the system under study. Therefore, as the results reveal, the method is robust against changes in the topology and the operating condition of the system and can yield great results even under a different topology and operating condition of the system.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed ML-based method for identifying critical distance relays. Section III describes the Random Forest algorithm, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained RF model, as well as the grid search and the K-fold 
 3 cross-validation methods. Section IV evaluates the performance of the trained model in terms of the metric used. Also, Section IV further assesses the performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays and capturing the behavior of the system by performing transient stability studies of several contingencies on the WECC system using the proposed method. Conclusions are provided in Section V. II.  IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DISTANCE RELAYS The ML-based method developed in this paper works based on the latent correlation between the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays during the early stages of a contingency and the behavior of the distance relays for several seconds later. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed method. During the training stage, to create a comprehensive dataset for training/testing an ML model, extensive transient stability studies are performed on different types of contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The contingencies studied include bus faults and line faults followed by removing one or more transmission lines, as well as generator outage contingencies. During these studies, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance trajectories observed by the distance relays at the time of the fault and up to 1 cycle after the fault are captured and used as the features of the ML model. The operations of the distance relays during each contingency are used to label the dataset (1 for operation and 0 for not operation). Note that due to the software limitations, only the distance relays on the high voltage transmission lines with the voltage level of 345 kV and above are modeled in transient stability studies of the contingencies. If available, the results of the offline transient stability studies can be combined with the historical records of the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays in the system during prior contingencies along with the record of their operations. Note that after the model is trained using the comprehensive dataset, it is used to identify critical distance relays for any contingency. Hence, the process of building a comprehensive dataset through conducting extensive transient stability studies is only performed once at the training stage. The problem of predicting distance relay operations is a binary classification problem (with two classes of 0 and 1). Throughout this paper, the following definitions for class 0 and class 1 of the classification problem hold:  • Class 0: This class represents the samples of no-operation of distance relays, i.e., the samples where a distance relay does not operate for the entire simulation time, in the dataset.  • Class 1: This class represents the samples of distance relay operations in the dataset.  Different types of ML algorithms can be used for classification problems. As it can train robust models with high accuracy and prediction/training speed, an RF classifier is used in this paper to train the ML model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. During the grid search, to realistically evaluate the performances of the RF models trained with different combinations of hyperparameter values, the K-fold cross-validation method is utilized. The grid search and the  
 Fig. 1. The flowchart of the proposed method. K-fold cross-validation methods are explained in Section III. C and Section III. D, respectively. In the application stage, the trained model is used to identify the critical distance relays for any contingency under study. Note that this contingency might be a new contingency that has not been studied during building the dataset for training/testing the model; as the results of this paper confirm, the proposed approach performs well for such out-of-sample scenarios. First, the proposed method performs an initial transient stability study of the contingency under study without modeling any distance relays. Since the trained model only needs the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays up to 1 cycle after the fault as its input features, the initial transient stability study can be terminated 1 cycle after the fault, which can considerably reduce the simulation time. Note that the impedance trajectories observed by distance relays can be easily captured at each time interval of the transient stability study without any change in the existing practice of performing these studies and without any need to model the distance relays. Next, the method extracts the input features of the trained model from the results of the initial transient stability study. Then, the trained model predicts whether any of the distance relays in the system operate for the entire simulation time or not. The distance relays that are predicted to operate are identified as the critical distance relays for the contingency. Thus, at the next stage, their dynamic models are included in the dynamic file of the system. In this stage, the updated relay settings for the identified critical distance relays can be obtained (from the protection groups of utilities) and be included in the dynamic models of the distance relays to achieve a more precise assessment of the system behavior. Finally, using the stability software, the method performs a transient stability study with only modeling the critical distance relays to capture the response of the system to the contingency. Note that unlike the case of modeling all the distance relays, the small number of the critical distance relays identified by the proposed method can easily be included in stability studies without violating the current limitations of stability analysis software tools. 

 4 III.  THE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, THE METRICS USED, THE GRID SEARCH METHOD, AND THE K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD A brief explanation of the Random Forest algorithm along with its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations, are provided in this section. Also, the metrics, the grid search method, and the K-fold cross-validation method used in this paper are explained.  A.  Random Forest The RF algorithm is a well-known and successful ML algorithm for classification and regression problems. Composed of multiple single decision trees (DTs), the RF operates as an ensemble ML algorithm. Each individual DT of the RF is trained on a subset of the dataset and uses a subset of the features as its input. In classification problems, the output of the RF is selected based on the most votes from its individual DTs [26]. Numerous advantages of the RF have made it a popular ML algorithm to be widely deployed in many problems [27]. Some of the most important advantages of the RF that make it suitable for the problem of this paper are as follows: • One of the widely known problems of a single DT is overfitting. This causes DT to have a poor performance on new datasets. To overcome this problem, the RF algorithm trains multiple DTs on different parts of the training set using bootstrap aggregating or bagging techniques. This eliminates the overfitting problem of a single DT. Hence, the RF can have high accuracy on new datasets [28]. • The performance of the RF in handling unbalanced and non-linear datasets is outstanding [28]. For the application of this paper, as the dataset is unbalanced and has more cases of class 0 than class 1, this feature of the RF algorithm is of great importance. • The RF has a high training and prediction speed, and it can easily handle high dimensional data, as it only uses a subset of features to train each DT. Also, as the RF algorithm is parallelizable, the process can be divided between multiple computers, which can significantly increase the speed of the algorithm. The high speed of the RF algorithm is favorable for the problem of this paper since it enables the RF to predict the operation of all the distance relays in bulk power systems in a short time [27], [28].  B.  Metrics To evaluate the performance of the trained model two metrics of Recall and Precision are used in this paper. These metrics are introduced in this subsection.  Note that, in the formulations of Recall and Precision, TP is the number of true-positive cases, i.e., the cases of distance relay operations (class 1) that the trained model correctly predicts as operation cases. FN is the number of false-negative cases, i.e., the distance relay operation cases that the trained model erroneously predicts as no-operation cases (class 0). Finally, FP is the number of false-positive cases, i.e., the no-operation cases of distance relays that the trained model erroneously predicts as operation cases. Recall or true-positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of all the positive cases, i.e., distance relay operation cases in this paper, 
that the trained model correctly predicts as positive cases. Recall can be formulated using (1) [29]. 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=	!"!"#$% (1) In the application of identifying critical distance relays, it is of the highest importance that the trained model does not miss any distance relay operation. In other words, ideally, the trained model should correctly predict all the distance relay operations. Hence, FN should be very low, and the Recall value should be very high (close to 1) to guarantee that all the distance relay operations are captured by the trained model. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing the Recall value is considered the objective of the grid search on the hyperparameters of the RF. Precision is defined as the fraction of all the positive predictions of the trained model that are correct predictions. Precision can be formulated using (2) [29]. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=	!"!"#$" (2) In this paper, a high number of false-positive cases show that the trained model is prone to misclassify many of the no-operation cases of distance relays as operation cases and identify those distance relays as critical. Therefore, many distance relays might be included in the dynamic file of the system, which is undesirable; modeling many distance relays might cause the same challenges as modeling all the distance relays. However, modeling additional distance relays in the final stability analysis will not impact the accuracy of the analysis as long as the number of these relays does not exceed the limitation of transient stability analysis software tools and the relay settings are accurate. Thus, although maximizing the Precision value is not considered the main objective, it is tried to achieve a suitable value for Precision that does not result in the modeling of a large number of distance relays in transient stability studies. C.  Grid search method The grid search, also known as parameter sweep, is a traditional method to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML algorithm. In grid search, an exhaustive search is performed through a specified range of the hyperparameter space of the ML algorithm. A performance measure should be considered to direct the grid search in optimizing the hyperparameters. In this paper, as mentioned earlier, maximizing Recall value is considered the performance measure. The performance metric is measured by applying the cross-validation method at each iteration of the grid search method [30]-[32].   The grid search method can be easily used to optimize the hyperparameters of an ML model. Its biggest disadvantage is that when the number of hyperparameters to be tuned increases, this method can be computationally heavy and time-consuming. However, because the hyperparameters to be tuned are usually independent of each other, the processing task of the grid search can be divided into several parallel tasks with little or no effort, and each task can be performed with a separate computer [33].   D.   K-fold cross-validation The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performances of the models trained at each iteration of the grid 
 5 search on new and out-of-sample cases. The method divides the dataset into K folds and at each iteration, it selects one of the folds as the test set and the remaining K-1 folds as the training set. Then, a model is trained on the training set and is tested on the test set. The score/error of the model is recorded at each iteration. The iterations stop when all the folds are used as a test set. The average of the recorded scores/errors (Recall value in this paper) in all the iterations is the performance metric for comparing the performances of the trained models [34]-[35].  IV.  CASE STUDIES The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The system includes 23297 buses, 18347 lines, 4224 generators, and 9050 transformers. The maximum generation capacity and the load of the system are 281.38 GW and 174.3 GW, respectively. The PSLF software is used for performing transient stability studies to create the dataset required for training and testing the RF model. Overall, 929 contingencies under different operating conditions and topologies of the system are studied. To be able to observe the behavior of distance relays in these studies, a reference dynamic file is created for the WECC system that includes two types of widely used distance relay models from the PSLF model library [36], namely, “Zlin1” and “Zlinw”. Zlin1 is a distance relay model in the PSLF model library that includes three operation zones [36]. Zlin1 needs to be modeled on each line with its specific settings. On the other hand, Zlinw is a generic distance relay model in the PSLF model library with two operation zones [36]. Unlike Zlin1, Zlinw does not need to be modeled for every line with its specific settings; rather, it monitors all the lines between its minimum and maximum voltage settings. Each of these distance relay models is used to model the distance relays on a subset of the lines of the system depending on the voltage level of the lines. Table I shows the voltage level of the lines whose distance relays are modeled with the Zlin1 and Zlinw models.  Table I. The voltage level of the lines modeled with Zlin1 and Zlinw models Model Transmission lines voltage level Zlin1 > 345 kV Zlinw 100 kV – 345 kV Note that since the Zlin1 model needs to be included for each line, separately, it is only modeled on the lines with a voltage level equal to or higher than 345 kV since these lines are the most critical lines of the system. Modeling Zlin1 on every line overwhelms the dynamic file of the system and exceeds the current limitation of the PSLF software tool. Therefore, for the lines with a lower voltage level, the Zlinw model is used, as this model does not need to be included on each line, separately. The well-known “scikit-learn” library [37] in Python is used to train the RF model. To achieve the best performance, a two-stage grid search method with the objective of maximizing the Recall metric is used to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation method with 5 folds is used to assess the performances of the trained models. The most important hyperparameters of the RF classifier are class weights, the number of trees in the forest, the maximum 
depth of the trees, the minimum sample split (MSS), the minimum sample leaf (MSL), the number of features considered when looking for the best split, and whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. Precise tuning of these hyperparameters is critical for enhancing the performance of the trained model. Explaining the role of each of these hyperparameters in the performance of the RF model is out of the scope of this paper, and more details in this regard can be found in the “scikit-learn” library [37]. These hyperparameters can take a wide range of values. Hence, at the first stage of the grid search, an approximation of the best value for each hyperparameter is obtained. Then, at the second stage, the grid search method searches around the approximate value obtained from the first stage to find the exact value for each hyperparameter that yields the best performance.  To show the impact of changing each hyperparameter on the performances of the trained models, the change in the Recall value for the various number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of trees is provided in Fig. 2(a). Also, the change in the Recall value for the various class weights and the number of trees in the forest is provided in Fig. 2(b). Note that, in Fig. 2(b), the set of the numbers on the X-axis (the class weight axis) shows the weight of each class. For example, “0:1, 1:10” means the weight of 1 for class 0 and the weight of 10 for class 1. The other sets of numbers are interpreted, likewise. The “balanced” weight on this axis means a weight for a class that is inversely proportional to the class frequency in the input dataset [37]. For example, if the “balanced” option is used for the class weight and the number of samples in the dataset belonging to class 1 is 3 times that belonging to class 0, the weight of class 1 will be 1/3 of the weight of class 0.  Fig. 2(a) shows that in comparison to the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of trees has slightly more impact on the performance of the trained models. It also shows that the trained model has a better performance when the maximum depth of trees is set to 10. Fig. 2(b) shows that the class weights have the highest impact on the performance of the trained model, and as the weight of class 1 increases, the Recall value increases, as well. Note that, this increase comes at the price of deteriorating the Precision value of the trained model. Therefore, although the weight of 100 for class 1 gives the highest Recall value in the first stage of the grid search method (above 0.99), the performance of the trained model in terms of the Precision va...

**Summary of the Paper**

The paper proposes a machine learning-based method for identifying critical distance relays for transient stability studies. The method uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system and is less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems.

The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mBased on the provided full text, I will help you summarize the paper and provide additional information as needed.

To summarize the paper, I will first search for the paper based on the title and authors. If the paper is found, I will then extract the paper ID and use it to summarize the paper.

However, since the paper is already provided in full text, I will instead provide a concise summary of the paper.

**Summary of the Paper**

The paper proposes a machine learning-based method for identifying critical distance relays for transient stability studies. The method uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system and is less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems.

The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

**Additional Information**

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the random forest algorithm and its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations. The paper also explains the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including Recall and Precision. The paper provides a two-stage grid search method to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to assess the performances of the trained models.

The paper also provides a case study on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

I hope this summary and additional information are helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mBased on the provided full text, I will help you summarize the paper and provide additional information as needed.

To summarize the paper, I will first search for the paper based on the title and authors. If the paper is found, I will then extract the paper ID and use it to summarize the paper.

However, since the paper is already provided in full text, I will instead provide a concise summary of the paper.

**Summary of the Paper**

The paper proposes a machine learning-based method for identifying critical distance relays for transient stability studies. The method uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system and is less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems.

The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

**Additional Information**

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the random forest algorithm and its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations. The paper also explains the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including Recall and Precision. The paper provides a two-stage grid search method to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to assess the performances of the trained models.

The paper also provides a case study on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

I hope this summary and additional information are helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mBased on the provided full text, I will help you summarize the paper and provide additional information as needed.

To summarize the paper, I will first search for the paper based on the title and authors. If the paper is found, I will then extract the paper ID and use it to summarize the paper.

However, since the paper is already provided in full text, I will instead provide a concise summary of the paper.

**Summary of the Paper**

The paper proposes a machine learning-based method for identifying critical distance relays for transient stability studies. The method uses the results of early-terminated stability studies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in those studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load under different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results show the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance relays. The method eliminates the challenges associated with modeling all the distance relays in the system and is less challenging to keep the updated setting information for this small subset of distance relays in the dynamic files of bulk power systems.

The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

**Additional Information**

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the random forest algorithm and its advantages, which make it suitable for predicting distance relay operations. The paper also explains the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including Recall and Precision. The paper provides a two-stage grid search method to tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, and the K-fold cross-validation method is used to assess the performances of the trained models.

The paper also provides a case study on the actual WECC system data representing the 2018 summer peak load case. The results show that the method can identify all the critical distance relays that need to be modeled in the transient stability study of a contingency. The method is also fast and can be used in planning studies to promptly identify the critical distance relays that need to be included in the transient stability studies of the contingencies under study.

I hope this summary and additional information are helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.[0m
