    "abstract": "  A three-field local projection stabilized finite element method is developed\nfor computations of a 3D-axisymmetric buoyancy driven bubble rising in a liquid\ncolumn in which either the bubble or the liquid column can be viscoelastic. The\ntwo-phase flow is described by the time-dependent incompressible Navier--Stokes\nequations, whereas the viscoelasticity is modeled by the Giesekus constitutive\nequation in a time-dependent domain. The arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian~(ALE)\nformulation with finite elements is used to solve the governing equations in\nthe time-dependent domain. The interface-resolved moving meshes in ALE allows\nto incorporate the interfacial tension force and jumps in the material\nparameters accurately. An one-level Local Projection Stabilization~(LPS), which\nis based on an enriched approximation space and a discontinuous projection\nspace, where both spaces are defined on a same mesh is used to stabilize the\nmodel equations. The stabilized numerical scheme allows us to use equal order\ninterpolation spaces for the velocity and the viscoelastic stress, whereas\ninf-sup stable finite elements are used for the velocity and the pressure. A\ncomprehensive numerical investigation is performed for a Newtonian bubble\nrising in a viscoelastic fluid and a viscoelastic bubble rising in a Newtonian\nfluid. The influence of the viscosity ratio, Newtonian solvent ratio, Giesekus\nmobility factor and the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s number on the bubble dynamics are\nanalyzed. The numerical study shows that a Newtonian bubble rising in a\nviscoelastic fluid experiences an extended trailing edge with a cusp-like shape\nand also exhibits the negative wake phenomena. However, a viscoelastic bubble\nrising in a Newtonian fluid develops an indentation around the rear stagnation\npoint with a dimpled shape.\n",

    "abstract": "  The surface of a three dimensional topological insulator (TI) hosts surface\nstates whose properties are determined by a Dirac-like equation. The electronic\nsystem on the surface of TI nanowires with polygonal cross-sectional shape\nadopts the corresponding polygonal shape. In a constant transverse magnetic\nfield, such an electronic system exhibits rich properties as different facets\nof the polygon experience different values of the magnetic field due to the\nchanging magnetic field projection between facets. We investigate the energy\nspectrum and transport properties of nanowires where we consider three\ndifferent polygonal shapes, all showing distinct properties visible in the\nenergy spectrum and transport properties. Here we propose that the wire\nconductance can be used to differentiate between cross-sectional shapes of the\nnanowire by rotating the magnetic field around the wire. Distinguishing between\nthe different shapes also works in the presence of impurities as long as\nconductance steps are discernible, thus revealing the sub-band structure.\n",

We orthogonalize this ordered basis to obtain the Frenet\nframe $\\mathfrak{F}_{\\gamma}$ of $\\gamma$ assuming values in the orthogonal\ngroup $\\operatorname{SO}_{n+1}$ (or its universal double cover,\n$\\operatorname{Spin}_{n+1}$), which we decompose into Schubert or Bruhat cells.\nTo each nondegenerate curve $\\gamma$ we assign its itinerary: a word $w$ in the\nalphabet $S_{n+1}\\smallsetminus\\{e\\}$ that encodes the succession of non open\nSchubert cells pierced by the complete flag of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ spanned by\nthe columns of $\\mathfrak{F}_{\\gamma}$. Without loss of generality, we can\nfocus on nondegenerate curves with initial and final flags both fixed at the\n(non oriented) standard complete flag. For such curves, given a word $w$, the\nsubspace of curves following the itinerary $w$ is a contractible globally\ncollared topological submanifold of finite codimension. By a construction\nreminiscent of Poincar\\'e duality, we define abstract cell complexes mapped\ninto the original space of curves by weak homotopy equivalences. The gluing\ninstructions come from a partial order in the set of words. The main aim of\nthis construction is to attempt to determine the homotopy type of spaces of\nnondegenerate curves for $n>2$. The reader may want to contrast the present\npaper's combinatorial approach with the geometry-flavoured methods of previous\nworks.\n",

    "abstract": "  The performed systematic meta-analysis of the quality of data description\n(QDD) of existing event generators of nucleus-nucleus collisions allows us to\nextract a very important physical information. Our meta-analysis is dealing\nwith the results of 10 event generators which describe data measured in the\nrange of center of mass collision energies from 3.1 GeV to 17.3 GeV. It\nconsiders the mean deviation squared per number of experimental points obtained\nby these event generators, i.e. the QDD, as the results of independent\nmeta-measurements. These generators and their QDDs are divided in two groups.\nThe first group includes the generators which account for the quark-gluon\nplasma formation during nuclear collisions (QGP models), while the second group\nincludes the generators which do not assume the QGP formation in such\ncollisions (hadron gas models). Comparing the QDD of more than a hundred of\ndifferent data sets of strange hadrons by two groups of models, we found two\nregions of the equal quality description of data which are located at the\ncenter of mass collision energies 4.4-4.87 GeV and 10.8-12 GeV. At the\ncollision energies below 4.4 GeV the hadron gas models describe data much\nbetter than the QGP one and, hence, we associate this region with hadron phase.\nAt the collision energies between 5 GeV and 10.8 GeV and above 12 GeV we found\nthat QGP models describe data essentially better than the hadron gas ones and,\nhence, these regions we associate with the quark-gluon phase. As a result, the\ncollision energy regions 4.4-4.87 GeV and 10.8-12 GeV we interpret as the\nenergies of the hadron-quark-gluon mixed phase formation. Based on these\nfindings we argue that the most probable energy range of the QCD phase diagram\n(tri)critical endpoint is 12-14 GeV.\n",

This means that the average fixation probability of an\nadvantageous mutant or invader individual placed at some node is strictly less\nthan that of this individual placed in a well-mixed population. This leads the\nway to study more robust structures less prone to invasion, contrary to what\nhappens with the amplifiers of selection where the fixation probability is\nincreased on average for advantageous invader individuals. A few families of\namplifiers are known, although some effort was required to prove it. Here, we\nuse computer aided techniques to find an exact analytical expression of the\nfixation probability for some graphs of small order (equal to $6$, $8$ and\n$10$) proving that selection is effectively reduced for $r > 1$. Some numerical\nexperiments using Monte Carlo methods are also performed for larger graphs.\n",

    "abstract": "  With the puncture method for black hole simulations, the second infinity of a\nwormhole geometry is compactified to a single \"puncture point\" on the\ncomputational grid. The region surrounding the puncture quickly evolves to a\ntrumpet geometry. The computational grid covers only a portion of the trumpet\nthroat. It ends at a boundary whose location depends on resolution. This raises\nthe possibility that perturbations in the trumpet geometry could propagate down\nthe trumpet throat, reflect from the puncture boundary, and return to the black\nhole exterior with a resolution--dependent time delay. Such pathological\nbehavior is not observed. This is explained by the observation that some\nperturbative modes propagate in the conformal geometry, others propagate in the\nphysical geometry. The puncture boundary exists only in the physical geometry.\nThe modes that propagate in the physical geometry are always directed away from\nthe computational domain at the puncture boundary. The finite difference\nstencils ensure that these modes are advected through the boundary with no\ncoupling to the modes that propagate in the conformal geometry. These results\nare supported by numerical experiments with a code that evolves spherically\nsymmetric gravitational fields with standard Cartesian finite difference\nstencils. The code uses the Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura formulation\nof Einstein's equations with 1+log slicing and gamma--driver shift conditions.\n",

    "abstract": "  Research in many fields has shown that transfer learning (TL) is well-suited\nto improve the performance of deep learning (DL) models in datasets with small\nnumbers of samples. This empirical success has triggered interest in the\napplication of TL to cognitive decoding analyses with functional neuroimaging\ndata. Here, we systematically evaluate TL for the application of DL models to\nthe decoding of cognitive states (e.g., viewing images of faces or houses) from\nwhole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. We first\npre-train two DL architectures on a large, public fMRI dataset and subsequently\nevaluate their performance in an independent experimental task and a fully\nindependent dataset. The pre-trained models consistently achieve higher\ndecoding accuracies and generally require less training time and data than\nmodel variants that were not pre-trained, clearly underlining the benefits of\npre-training. We demonstrate that these benefits arise from the ability of the\npre-trained models to reuse many of their learned features when training with\nnew data, providing deeper insights into the mechanisms giving rise to the\nbenefits of pre-training. Yet, we also surface nuanced challenges for\nwhole-brain cognitive decoding with DL models when interpreting the decoding\ndecisions of the pre-trained models, as these have learned to utilize the fMRI\ndata in unforeseen and counterintuitive ways to identify individual cognitive\nstates.\n",

Here\nwe study, by means of two dimensional numerical simulations, the linear phase\nand the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability within the\nframework of relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics, as appropriate in\nsituations where the Alfven velocity approaches the speed of light. It is found\nthat the linear phase of the instability closely matches the analysis in\nclassical MHD, where the growth rate scales with the Lundquist number S as\nS^-1/2, with the only exception of an enhanced inertial term due to the thermal\nand magnetic energy contributions. In addition, when thin current sheets of\ninverse aspect ratio scaling as S^-1/3 are considered, the so-called \"ideal\"\ntearing regime is retrieved, with modes growing independently on S and\nextremely fast, on only a few light crossing times of the sheet length. The\noverall growth of fluctuations is seen to solely depend on the value of the\nbackground Alfven velocity. In the fully nonlinear stage we observe an inverse\ncascade towards the fundamental mode, with Petschek-type supersonic jets\npropagating at the external Alfven speed from the X-point, and a fast\nreconnection rate at the predicted value R~(ln S)^-1.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present High-Throughput Hypothesis Evaluation in Description Logic\n(HT-HEDL). HT-HEDL is a high-performance hypothesis evaluation engine that\naccelerates hypothesis evaluation computations for inductive logic programming\n(ILP) learners using description logic (DL) for their knowledge representation;\nin particular, HT-HEDL targets accelerating computations for the\n$\\mathcal{ALCQI}^{\\mathcal{(D)}}$ DL language. HT-HEDL aggregates the computing\npower of multi-core CPUs with multi-GPUs to improve hypothesis computations at\ntwo levels: 1) the evaluation of a single hypothesis and 2) the evaluation of\nmultiple hypotheses (i.e., batch of hypotheses). In the first level, HT-HEDL\nuses a single GPU or a vectorized multi-threaded CPU to evaluate a single\nhypothesis. In vectorized multi-threaded CPU evaluation, classical (scalar) CPU\nmulti-threading is combined with CPU's extended vector instructions set to\nextract more CPU-based performance. The experimental results revealed that\nHT-HEDL increased performance using CPU-based evaluation (on a single\nhypothesis): from 20.4 folds using classical multi-threading to $\\sim85$ folds\nusing vectorized multi-threading. In the GPU-based evaluation, HT-HEDL achieved\nspeedups of up to $\\sim38$ folds for single hypothesis evaluation using a\nsingle GPU. To accelerate the evaluation of multiple hypotheses, HT-HEDL\ncombines, in parallel, GPUs with multi-core CPUs to increase evaluation\nthroughput (number of evaluated hypotheses per second). The experimental\nresults revealed that HT-HEDL increased evaluation throughput by up to 29.3\nfolds using two GPUs and up to $\\sim44$ folds using two GPUs combined with a\nCPU's vectorized multi-threaded evaluation.\n",

    "abstract": "  For flares to be generated, stars have to have a sufficiently deep outer\nconvection zone (F5 and later), strong large--scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type\nstars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type\nstars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless,\nflares have previously been detected in the Kepler lightcurves of 33 A-type\nstars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here we present new and\ndetailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the\nflare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33\nA-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field-of-view (FOV)\nreveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars\nand 5 stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our\ntargets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19\nstars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries.\nFurthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can\noriginate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of\nH$\\alpha$ emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or\nmagnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative\nexplanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars,\nbut find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type\nstars.\n",

Radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) are supposed in these\nfaint sources, which should radiate mostly in the hard X-ray band. We calculate\nthe contribution to the X-ray background from both the bright AGNs and the\nRIAFs in faint AGNs/normal galaxies. Our calculations show that both the\nobserved intensity and spectral shape of the XRB with an energy peak at ~30$\nkeV can be well reproduced without including the emission of Compton-thick\nAGNs, if the massive black holes in faint AGNs/normal galaxies are spinning\nrapidly with a~0.9 and accreting at rates ~1.0-3.0\\times 10^{-4}. It indicates\nthat less than ~5 per cent of local massive black hole mass density was\naccreted during radiatively inefficient accretion phases, which is obviously\nonly an upper limit, because Compton-thick AGNs have not been considered. If\nthe same number of the Compton-thick AGNs with log N_H=24-25 as those with log\nN_H=23-24 is considered, the fraction of local black hole mass density\naccumulated during inefficient accretion phases should be lower than ~2 per\ncent.\n",

Two\ndifferent aging regimes are observed: one is attained if the sample is\nrejuvenated before its gelation and one after the rejuvenation of the gelled\nsample. In the first regime, the application of shear fully rejuvenates the\nsample, as the system dynamics soon after shear cessation follow the same aging\nevolution characteristic of normal aging. In the second regime, aging proceeds\nvery fast after shear rejuvenation, and classical DLS cannot be used. An\noriginal protocol to measure an ensemble averaged intensity correlation\nfunction is proposed and its consistency with classical DLS is verified. The\nfast aging dynamics of rejuvenated gelled samples exhibit a power law\ndependence of the slow relaxation time on the waiting time.\n",

    "abstract": "  A rational perfect cuboid is a rectangular parallelepiped whose edges and\nface diagonals are given by rational numbers and whose space diagonal is equal\nto unity. Its existence is equivalent to the existence of a perfect cuboid with\nall integer edges and diagonals. Finding such a cuboid or proving its\nnon-existence is an old unsolved problem. Recently, based on a symmetry\napproach, the equations of a perfect cuboid were transformed to factor\nequations. The factor equations turned out to be solvable and, being solved,\nhave led to a pair of inverse problems. Our efforts in the present paper are\ntoward solving these inverse problems. Algebraic parametrizations for their\nsolutions using algebraic functions of two rational arguments are found.\n",

    "abstract": "  We use inverse methods of statistical mechanics to explore trade-offs\nassociated with designing interactions to stabilize self-assembled structures\nagainst changes in density or temperature. Specifically, we find\nisotropic,convex-repulsive pair potentials that maximize the density range for\nwhich a two-dimensional square lattice is the stable ground state subject to a\nconstraint on the chemical potential advantage it exhibits over competing\nstructures (i.e., 'depth' of the associated minimum on the chemical potential\nhypersurface). We formulate the design problem as a non-linear program, which\nwe solve numerically. This allows us to efficiently find optimized interactions\nfor a wide range of possible chemical potential constraints. We find that\nassemblies designed to exhibit a large chemical potential advantage at a\nspecified density have a smaller overall range of densities for which they are\nstable. This trend can be understood by considering the separation-dependent\nfeatures of the pair potential and its gradient required to enhance the\nstability of the target structure relative to competitors. Using molecular\ndynamics simulations, we further show that potentials designed with larger\nchemical potential advantages exhibit higher melting temperatures.\n",

In this paper, we present how EDM can\nbe applied to monitor and control stochastic projects.

    "abstract": "  In this work a novel radar simulation concept is introduced that allows to\nsimulate realistic radar data for Range, Doppler, and for arbitrary antenna\npositions in an efficient way. Further, it makes it possible to automatically\nannotate the simulated radar signal by allowing to decompose it into different\nparts. This approach allows not only almost perfect annotations possible, but\nalso allows the annotation of exotic effects, such as multi-path effects or to\nlabel signal parts originating from different parts of an object. This is\npossible by adapting the computation process of a Monte Carlo shooting and\nbouncing rays (SBR) simulator. By considering the hits of each simulated ray,\nvarious meta data can be stored such as hit position, mesh pointer, object IDs,\nand many more. This collected meta data can then be utilized to predict the\nchange of path lengths introduced by object motion to obtain Doppler\ninformation or to apply specific ray filter rules in order obtain radar signals\nthat only fulfil specific conditions, such as multiple bounces or containing\nspecific object IDs. Using this approach, perfect and otherwise almost\nimpossible annotations schemes can be realized.\n",

The temperature jump at a narrow shock front, where an\ninitial magnetic field existing in inflowing matter rises sharply, is the\nsource of the CME that prevails significantly the erasure of the CME due to the\nspin-flip through Coulomb collisions in plasma. The growth of the magnetic\nfield just behind the shock given by the instability term $\\nabla\\times (\\alpha\n{\\bf B})$ in induction equation, stops after a successful SN explosion that\nthrows out the mantle of a protoneutron star. As a result, such an explosion\ninterrupts the transfer of strongly magnetized plasma from the shock onto NS\nsurface and leads to the saturation of the magnetic field. Assuming the rigid\nprotostar rotation, we employ the mean field dynamo, which is similar to the\n$\\alpha^2$-dynamo known in the standard magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The novelty\nof our model is that $\\alpha^2$-dynamo is based on concepts of particle\nphysics, applied in MHD, rather than by a mirror asymmetry of convective\nvortices in the rotating convection.\n",

Finally, we discuss open challenges\nand potential research directions in this area.

Through analytical calculations of the negativity\nin the ground state(s) of the toric code model, we explicitly show that the\nentanglement of a region $A$ and its complement $B$ is the sum of two types of\ncontributions. The first type of contributions consists of \\textit{boundary\nentanglement}, which we see to be insensitive to tracing out the interior of\n$A$ and $B$. It therefore entangles only degrees of freedom in $A$ and $B$ that\nare close to their common boundary. As it is well-known, each boundary\ncontribution is proportional to the size of the relevant boundary separating\n$A$ and $B$ and it includes an additive, universal correction. The second\ncontribution appears only when $A$ and $B$ are non-contractible regions (e.g.\non a torus) and it consists of long-range entanglement, which we see to be\ndestroyed when tracing out a non-contractible region in the interior of $A$ or\n$B$. Only the long-range contribution to the entanglement may depend on the\nspecific ground state under consideration.\n",

    "abstract": "  The magnetization dynamics of the triangular lattice of Ising spin chains is\ninvestigated in the framework of a two-dimensional model. The rigid chains are\nassumed to interact with the nearest neighboring chains, an external magnetic\nfield, and a heat reservoir that causes the chains to change their states\nrandomly with time. A probability of a single spin-flip process is assumed in a\nGlauber-like form. This technique allows describing properly the steps in the\nmagnetization curves observed in Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ and their dependence on a\nmagnetic field sweep rate and temperature. A transition from a low-temperature\nto high-temperature phase is also observed.\n",

    "abstract": "  This work aims to estimate time-resolved velocity field that is directly\nassociated with pressure fluctuations in a subsonic round jet. To achieve this\ngoal, synchronous measurements of the velocity field and in-flow pressure\nfluctuations were performed at Mach number 0.3. Two different experiment\ncampaigns were conducted, the first experimental campaign aims to explore the\ntime-resolved dynamics of the axisymmetric velocity components, and second\nexperiment focuses on the time-resolved, 2D velocity estimates on a streamwise\nplane. Two different methods were utilized to estimate the input-output\nrelation between velocity and in-flow pressure measurements. A hybrid approach\nbased on the spectral linear stochastic estimation and the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition was applied to setup the model in a linear manner, and a\nwavelet-based filter was implemented to attenuate the noise level in the\ncross-correlation functions. In addition, the pressure-velocity relationship\nwas also described by neural network architectures based on the multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) and bidirectional long-short-term-memory (LSTM). In both\nexperimental sets, pressure fluctuations inside the flow are found to be\nconnected to the streamwise convection of large-scale coherent structures in\nthe flow. A unique advantage of the bidirectional LSTM method was found among\nall estimation schemes is also reported in this work. The estimation result\nrepresents the space-time dynamics of the acoustic sources in the jet flow\nfield, and it is of great importance to understand the noise generation\nmechanism.\n",

    "abstract": "  Understanding and identifying the causes behind developers' emotions (e.g.,\nFrustration caused by `delays in merging pull requests') can be crucial towards\nfinding solutions to problems and fostering collaboration in open-source\ncommunities. Effectively identifying such information in the high volume of\ncommunications across the different project channels, such as chats, emails,\nand issue comments, requires automated recognition of emotions and their\ncauses. To enable this automation, large-scale software engineering-specific\ndatasets that can be used to train accurate machine learning models are\nrequired. However, such datasets are expensive to create with the variety and\ninformal nature of software projects' communication channels.\n  In this paper, we explore zero-shot LLMs that are pre-trained on massive\ndatasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting\nemotion causes in software engineering: ChatGPT, GPT-4, and flan-alpaca. Our\nevaluation indicates that these recently available models can identify emotion\ncategories when given detailed emotions, although they perform worse than the\ntop-rated models. For emotion cause identification, our results indicate that\nzero-shot LLMs are effective at recognizing the correct emotion cause with a\nBLEU-2 score of 0.598. To highlight the potential use of these techniques, we\nconduct a case study of the causes of Frustration in the last year of\ndevelopment of a popular open-source project, revealing several interesting\ninsights.\n",

    "abstract": "  Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security\nincidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we\ndeveloped Microsoft Copilot for Security Guided Response (CGR), an\nindustry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key\ntasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by\nidentifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the\nincident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive;\nand (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is\nintegrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide,\ngenerating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our\nextensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with\nsecurity experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers\nhigh-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive\noverview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first\ncybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth.\nAdditionally, we release GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world\nsecurity incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M incidents annotated with\nground-truth triage labels by customer security analysts. This dataset\nrepresents the first large-scale cybersecurity resource of its kind, supporting\nthe development and evaluation of guided response systems and beyond.\n",

    "abstract": "  Position bias is a critical problem in information retrieval when dealing\nwith implicit yet biased user feedback data. Unbiased ranking methods typically\nrely on causality models and debias the user feedback through inverse\npropensity weighting. While practical, these methods still suffer from two\nmajor problems. First, when inferring a user click, the impact of the\ncontextual information, such as documents that have been examined, is often\nignored. Second, only the position bias is considered but other issues resulted\nfrom user browsing behaviors are overlooked. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Deep Recurrent Survival Ranking (DRSR), a unified framework to\njointly model user's various behaviors, to (i) consider the rich contextual\ninformation in the ranking list; and (ii) address the hidden issues underlying\nuser behaviors, i.e., to mine observe pattern in queries without any click\n(non-click queries), and to model tracking logs which cannot truly reflect the\nuser browsing intents (untrusted observation). Specifically, we adopt a\nrecurrent neural network to model the contextual information and estimates the\nconditional likelihood of user feedback at each position. We then incorporate\nsurvival analysis techniques with the probability chain rule to mathematically\nrecover the unbiased joint probability of one user's various behaviors. DRSR\ncan be easily incorporated with both point-wise and pair-wise learning\nobjectives. The extensive experiments over two large-scale industrial datasets\ndemonstrate the significant performance gains of our model comparing with the\nstate-of-the-arts.\n",

    "abstract": "  Quantum Computing (QC) offers significant potential to enhance scientific\ndiscovery in fields such as quantum chemistry, optimization, and artificial\nintelligence. Yet QC faces challenges due to the noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum era's inherent external noise issues. This paper discusses the\nintegration of QC as a computational accelerator within classical scientific\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) systems. By leveraging a broad spectrum of\nsimulators and hardware technologies, we propose a hardware-agnostic framework\nfor augmenting classical HPC with QC capabilities. Drawing on the HPC expertise\nof the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the HPC lifecycle management of\nthe Department of Energy (DOE), our approach focuses on the strategic\nincorporation of QC capabilities and acceleration into existing scientific HPC\nworkflows. This includes detailed analyses, benchmarks, and code optimization\ndriven by the needs of the DOE and ORNL missions. Our comprehensive framework\nintegrates hardware, software, workflows, and user interfaces to foster a\nsynergistic environment for quantum and classical computing research. This\npaper outlines plans to unlock new computational possibilities, driving forward\nscientific inquiry and innovation in a wide array of research domains.\n",

Here ${\\vec {\\cal\nK}}_{(int)}$ is the Lorentz boost generator in the unfaithful internal\nrealization of the Poincare' group and its vanishing is the gauge fixing to the\nrest-frame conditions ${\\vec {\\cal P}}_{(int)} \\approx 0$. We show how to find\nthis collective variable for the following isolated systems: a) charged\nparticles with a Coulomb plus Darwin mutual interaction; b) transverse\nradiation field; c) charged particles with a mutual Coulomb interaction plus a\ntransverse electro-magnetic field.\n  Then we define the Dixon multipolar expansion for the open particle\nsubsystem. We also define the relativistic electric dipole approximation of\natomic physics in the rest-frame instant form and we find the a possible\nrelativistic generalization of the electric dipole representation.\n",

Next, we describe the factorisation properties of\ntwo-dimensional quantum field theories in the presence of defects and compare\nthe correlators for different defect networks in the quantum WZW model.

We present here a multi-band search for the host galaxy\nof the long dark GRB 050219A within the enhanced Swift/XRT error circle. We\nused spectroscopic observations acquired with VLT/X-shooter to determine the\nredshift and star-formation rate of the putative host galaxy. We compared the\nresults with the optical/IR spectral energy distribution obtained with\ndifferent facilities. Surprisingly, the host galaxy is a old and quiescent\nearly-type galaxy at z = 0.211 characterised by an unprecedentedly low specific\nstar-formation rate. It is the first LGRB host to be also an early-type\npost-starburst galaxy. This is further evidence that GRBs can explode in all\nkind of galaxies, with the only requirement being an episode of star-formation.\n",

As two\nrepresentative models, we consider the JR model composed of a single fermion\nfield having a complex mass and the generalized JR model with two massless but\ninteracting fermion fields. The JR model shows nonchiral solitons with the\n$Z_2$ rotation symmetry, whereas it shows chiral solitons with the broken $Z_2$\nrotation symmetry. In the generalized JR model, only nonchiral solitons can\nemerge with only $Z_2$ rotation symmetry, whereas both chiral and nonchiral\nsolitons can exist with enhanced $Z_4$ rotation symmetry. Moreover, we find\nthat the nonchiral solitons have $C, P$ symmetries while the chiral solitons do\nnot, which can be explained by the symmetry-invariant lines connecting\ndegenerate vacua. Finally, we find the symmetry correspondence between\nmultiply-degenerate global vacua and solitons such that ${T}$, ${C}$, ${P}$\nsymmetries of a soliton inherit from global minima that are connected by the\nsoliton, which provides a novel tool for the characterization of topological\nsolitons.\n",

    "abstract": "  Societies consisting of cooperative individuals seem to require for their\ncontinuing success that defectors be policed. The precise connection between\npunishers and benefits, population structure, and division of labour, however,\nremains ill-understood. Many models assume costly \"peer punishment\" to enforce\ncooperation, but results in the economics literature suggest that this\nassumption may not be generally valid. In many human and animal societies,\nthere is a division of labour between a purely supportive majority and a\ndedicated minority of police-like enforcers. Here we present several extensions\nto the Public Goods Game with punishment which allow for this possibility, and\nevaluate their influence on the level of cooperative behaviour. We find that a\nstructure of separate subpopulations, which only interact through migration of\nindividuals, can have a strong effect on the evolutionary dynamics of a system\nand significantly facilitate cooperation. Forcing defectors to contribute and\nenabling fitness transfers to punishers both have a weak positive effect on\ncooperation levels. In the presence of group competition, however, evolutionary\neffects can paradoxically hinder cooperation.\n",

    "abstract": "  The dynamics of cyber threats are increasingly complex, making it more\nchallenging than ever for organizations to obtain in-depth insights into their\ncyber security status. Therefore, organizations rely on Cyber Situational\nAwareness (CSA) to support them in better understanding the threats and\nassociated impacts of cyber events. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of\ncyber security data, often with multidimensional attributes, sophisticated\nvisualization techniques are needed to achieve CSA. However, there have been no\nprevious attempts to systematically review and analyze the scientific\nliterature on CSA visualizations. In this paper, we systematically select and\nreview 54 publications that discuss visualizations to support CSA. We extract\ndata from these papers to identify key stakeholders, information types, data\nsources, and visualization techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the level of CSA\nsupported by the visualizations, alongside examining the maturity of the\nvisualizations, challenges, and practices related to CSA visualizations to\nprepare a full analysis of the current state of CSA in an organizational\ncontext. Our results reveal certain gaps in CSA visualizations. For instance,\nthe largest focus is on operational-level staff, and there is a clear lack of\nvisualizations targeting other types of stakeholders such as managers,\nhigher-level decision makers, and non-expert users. Most papers focus on threat\ninformation visualization, and there is a dearth of papers that visualize\nimpact information, response plans, and information shared within teams. Based\non the results that highlight the important concerns in CSA visualizations, we\nrecommend a list of future research directions.\n",

    "abstract": "  The observed Higgs mass $M_H=125.9\\pm0.4$GeV leads to the criticality of the\nStandard Model, that is, the Higgs potential becomes flat around the scale\n$10^{17\\text{--}18}$GeV for the top mass $171.3$GeV. Earlier we have proposed a\nHiggs inflation scenario in which this criticality plays a crucial role. In\nthis paper, we investigate detailed cosmological predictions of this scenario\nin light of the latest Planck and BICEP2 results. We find that this scenario\ncan be consistent with the constraint from the running index too. We also\ncompute the Higgs one-loop effective potential including the Higgs portal\nscalar dark matter, with the two-loop renormalization group equations and find\na constraint on the coupling between Higgs and dark matter depending on the\ninflationary parameters.\n",

    "abstract": "  Population structure has been known to substantially affect evolutionary\ndynamics. Networks that promote the spreading of fitter mutants are called\namplifiers of natural selection, and those that suppress the spreading of\nfitter mutants are called suppressors. Research in the past two decades has\nfound various families of amplifiers while suppressors still remain somewhat\nelusive. It has also been discovered that most networks are amplifiers under\nthe birth-death updating combined with uniform initialization, which is a\nstandard condition assumed widely in the literature. In the present study, we\nextend the birth-death processes to temporal (i.e., time-varying) networks. For\nthe sake of tractability, we restrict ourselves to switching temporal networks,\nin which the network structure alternates between two static networks at\nconstant time intervals. We show that, in a majority of cases, switching\nnetworks are less amplifying than both of the two static networks constituting\nthe switching networks. Furthermore, most small switching networks are\nsuppressors, which contrasts to the case of static networks.\n",

In particular, we study GNR with an inhomogeneous, out of plane\nGaussian deformation, connected to reservoirs. We observe an enhancement of the\ndensity of states in the deformed region, accompanied with a decrease in the\nconductance, signaling the presence of confined states. The local density of\nstates exhibits a six-fold symmetric structure with an oscillating sub-lattice\noccupation asymmetry, that persist for a wide range of energy and model\nparameters.\n",

    "abstract": "  The exploration of the Pluto-Charon system by the New Horizons spacecraft\nrepresents the first opportunity to understand the distribution of albedo and\nother photometric properties of the surfaces of objects in the Solar System's\n\"Third Zone\" of distant ice-rich bodies. Images of the entire illuminated\nsurface of Pluto and Charon obtained by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager\n(LORRI) camera provide a global map of Pluto that reveals surface albedo\nvariegations larger than any other Solar System world except for Saturn's moon\nIapetus. Normal reflectances on Pluto range from 0.08-1.0, and the low-albedo\nareas of Pluto are darker than any region of Charon. Charon exhibits a much\nblander surface with normal reflectances ranging from 0.20-0.73. Pluto's albedo\nfeatures are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous\nlow-albedo dust may be responsible for features seen to the west of the area\ninformally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon\nare latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker\nregions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole The\nphase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune\nbelieved to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar\nto that of the Moon. Preliminary Bond albedos are 0.25+/-0.03 for Charon and\n0.72+/-0.07 for Pluto. Maps of an approximation to the Bond albedo for both\nPluto and Charon are presented for the first time. Our work shows a connection\nbetween very high albedo (near unity) and planetary activity, a result that\nsuggests the KBO Eris may be currently active.\n",

Our mock galaxy catalog can\nimpressively well reproduce the observed spectroscopic redshift space\ndistortions (RSDs) in highly non-linear regimes down to very small scales,\nwhich is a robust test of the velocity field of our mock galaxy catalog. Based\non this mock galaxy catalog, we accurately, for the first time, measure the\npeculiar velocity probability distributions for the SDSS main galaxy samples.\nWe find that the systematics induced by the peculiar velocities of SDSS like\ngalaxies on the measured Hubble constant can be reduced to below\n$1\\%$($1\\sigma$) for GW host galaxies with a Hubble flow redshift just above\n$0.13$, a distance that can be well probed by future GW experiments and galaxy\nsurveys.\n",

However, how SMBHs grew to such\nhuge masses within the first billion years after the big bang remains elusive.\nOne possible explanation is that SMBHs grow quickly through the frequent\nmergers of galaxies, which provides sustainable gas to maintain rapid growth.\nThis study presents the hydrodynamics simulations of the SMBHs' growth with\ntheir host galaxies using the GIZMO code. In contrast to previous simulations,\nwe have developed a giant molecular cloud (GMC) model by separating\nmolecular-gas particles from the atomic-gas particles and then evolving them\nindependently. During major mergers, we show that the more massive molecular\ngas particles cloud bear stronger dynamical friction. Consequently, GMCs are\nsubstantially accreted onto the galactic centers that grow SMBHs from $\\sim\n10^{7}$ $\\rm M_\\odot$ to $\\sim 10^{9}\\, \\rm M_\\odot$ within $300$ Myr,\nexplaining the rapid growth of SMBHs, and this accretion also triggers a\nviolent starburst at the galactic center. Furthermore, we examine the impact of\nminor mergers on the bulge of a Milky-Way-like galaxy and find that the size\nand mass of the bulge can increase from $0.92$ kpc to $1.9$ kpc and from\n$4.7\\times 10^{10}\\, \\rm M_\\odot$ to $7\\times 10^{10}\\, \\rm M_\\odot$.\n",

    "abstract": "  Recently, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterized by neural\nnetworks have emerged as a powerful and promising tool to represent different\nkinds of signals due to its continuous, differentiable properties, showing\nsuperiorities to classical discretized representations. However, the training\nof neural networks for INRs only utilizes input-output pairs, and the\nderivatives of the target output with respect to the input, which can be\naccessed in some cases, are usually ignored. In this paper, we propose a\ntraining paradigm for INRs whose target output is image pixels, to encode image\nderivatives in addition to image values in the neural network. Specifically, we\nuse finite differences to approximate image derivatives. We show how the\ntraining paradigm can be leveraged to solve typical INRs problems, i.e., image\nregression and inverse rendering, and demonstrate this training paradigm can\nimprove the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of INRs.

Adaptability\nis achieved by optimizing over a range of off-nominal flight conditions\nincluding perturbation of aerodynamic coefficient parameters, actuator failure\nscenarios, and sensor noise. The system maps observations directly to commanded\nbank angle and angle of attack rates. These observations include a velocity\nfield tracking error formulated using parallel navigation, but adapted to work\nover long trajectories where the Earth's curvature must be taken into account.\nMinimizing the tracking error keeps the curved space line of sight to the\ntarget location aligned with the vehicle's velocity vector. The optimized\nguidance system will then induce trajectories that bring the vehicle to the\ntarget location with a high degree of accuracy at the designated terminal\nspeed, while satisfying heating rate, load, and dynamic pressure constraints.\nWe demonstrate the adaptability of the guidance system by testing over flight\nconditions that were not experienced during optimization. The guidance system's\nperformance is then compared to that of a linear quadratic regulator tracking\nan optimal trajectory.\n",

Conventional downscaling\nmethods for generating these data have a high computational burden and require\nextensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep\nlearning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method, using generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind\nresource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting\nReanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). We achieve results comparable in historical\naccuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional downscaling by training\na GAN model with ERA5 low-resolution input and high-resolution targets from the\nWind Integration National Dataset, while reducing computational costs over\ndynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. Spatiotemporal\ncross-validation shows low error and high correlations with observations and\nexcellent agreement with holdout data across distributions of physical metrics.\nWe apply this approach to downscale 30-km hourly ERA5 data to 2-km 5-minute\nwind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over\nEastern Europe. Uncertainty is estimated over the period with observational\ndata by additionally downscaling the members of the European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasting Ensemble of Data Assimilations. Comparisons\nagainst observational data from the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest\nSystem and multiple wind farms show comparable performance to the CONUS\nvalidation.

This optical\nsystem transmits the electric field, emitted by the object surface, towards the\nimage surface producing the same field distribution in both surfaces. In\nparticular, a Dirac delta electric field in the object surface is focused\nwithout diffraction limit to the Dirac delta electric field in the image\nsurface. The Maxwell Fish Eye lens (MFE) and the Spherical Geodesic Waveguide\n(SGW) have been claimed to break the diffraction limit using positive\nrefraction with a different meaning. In these cases, it has been considered the\npower transmission from a point source to a point receptor, which falls\ndrastically when the receptor is displaced from the focus by a distance much\nsmaller than the wavelength. Although these systems can detect displacements up\nto Wavelength/500, they cannot be compared to the NRL, since the concept of the\nobject and image surface is not established. Here, it is presented an analysis\nof the SGW with defined object and image surfaces. The results show that a\nDirac delta electric field on the object surface produces an image below the\nrefraction limits on the image surface.\n",

In\nan effort to tackle the many-body problem, an empirically determined\nsymmetry-dependent partition fraction for the electron-electron interaction\nenergy between two interacting states of helium atom is suggested in this\nstudy. Using the partition fraction and the lowest-order approximation of the\nmultipole series expansion of the electron-electron interaction, a simple\nparameter-free pseudopotential for a two-electron system is derived. The\ngroundstate, singly and doubly excited state non-relativistic energies\ngenerated by the pseudopotential are in reasonable agreement with literature\nvalues.\n",

    "abstract": "  There is a remarkable correlation between the spin periods of the accreting\nneutron stars in Be/X-ray binaries (BeXBs) and their orbital periods . Recently\nKnigge et al. (2011) showed that the distribution of the spin periods contains\ntwo distinct subpopulations peaked at $\\sim 10$ s and $\\sim 200$ s\nrespectively, and suggested that they may be related to two types of supernovae\nfor the formation of the neutron stars, i.e., core-collapse and\nelectron-capture supernovae. Here we propose that the bimodal spin period\ndistribution is likely to be ascribed to different accretion modes of the\nneutron stars in BeXBs. When the neutron star tends to capture material from\nthe warped, outer part of the Be star disk and experiences giant outbursts, a\nradiatively-cooling dominated disk is formed around the neutron star, which\nspins up the neutron star, and is responsible for the short period\nsubpopulation. In BeXBs that are dominated by normal outbursts or persistent,\nthe accretion flow is advection-dominated or quasi-spherical. The spin-up\nprocess is accordingly inefficient, leading to longer periods of the neuron\nstars. The potential relation between the subpopulations and the supernova\nmechanisms is also discussed.\n",

However, these networks are computationally expensive and\nparameter-heavy. iSTFTNet addresses these limitations by integrating inverse\nshort-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) into the network, achieving both speed and\nparameter efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an extension to iSTFTNet,\ntermed HiFTNet, which incorporates a harmonic-plus-noise source filter in the\ntime-frequency domain that uses a sinusoidal source from the fundamental\nfrequency (F0) inferred via a pre-trained F0 estimation network for fast\ninference speed. Subjective evaluations on LJSpeech show that our model\nsignificantly outperforms both iSTFTNet and HiFi-GAN, achieving\nground-truth-level performance. HiFTNet also outperforms BigVGAN-base on\nLibriTTS for unseen speakers and achieves comparable performance to BigVGAN\nwhile being four times faster with only $1/6$ of the parameters. Our work sets\na new benchmark for efficient, high-quality neural vocoding, paving the way for\nreal-time applications that demand high quality speech synthesis.\n",

This general behavior is predicted in\nmodels of gravitational collapse with thermal plus magnetic support and the\nlower values in L694-2 may be due to its lower mass or a slightly earlier\nevolutionary state.

In this paper we assume that the inclusions to\nbe of $C^{1, \\gamma}$, weaker than the previous $C^{2, \\gamma}$ assumption. To\novercome this new difficulty, we make use of $W^{1, p}$ estimates for elliptic\nsystem with right hand side in divergence form, instead of a direct $W^{2, p}$\nargument for $C^{2, \\gamma}$ inclusion case, and combine with the Campanato's\napproach to establish the optimal gradient estimates, including upper and lower\nbounds.

Spatially\nresolved HI absorption is detected against the morphologically complex and\nextended 21-cm radio continuum emission, consistent with two counterrotating\ndisks of neutral hydrogen, with a small bridge of gas connecting the two.\n  We propose a merger model in which the two nuclei represent the galaxy cores\nwhich have survived the initial encounter and are now in the final stages of\nmerging, similar to conclusions drawn from previous CO studies (Sakamoto,\nScoville & Yun 1999). However, we suggest that instead of being coplanar with\nthe main CO disk (in which the eastern nucleus is embedded), the western\nnucleus lies above it and, as suggested by bridge of HI connecting the two\nnuclei, will soon complete its final merger with the main disk. We suggest that\nthe collection of radio supernovae (RSN) detected in VLBA studies in the more\ncompact western nucleus represent the second burst of star formation associated\nwith this final merger stage and that free-free absorption due to ionised gas\nin the bulge-like component can account for the observed RSN distribution.\n(Abridged)\n",

    "abstract": "  We introduce BSD-GAN, a novel multi-branch and scale-disentangled training\nmethod which enables unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to\nlearn image representations at multiple scales, benefiting a wide range of\ngeneration and editing tasks. The key feature of BSD-GAN is that it is trained\nin multiple branches, progressively covering both the breadth and depth of the\nnetwork, as resolutions of the training images increase to reveal finer-scale\nfeatures. Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network of\nBSD-GAN, is deliberately split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to,\nand is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During\ntraining, we progressively \"de-freeze\" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new\nset of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network\nlayers are added. A consequence of such an explicit sub-vector designation is\nthat we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes\nwhich model different feature scales.Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our training method in scale-disentangled learning of image\nrepresentations and synthesis of novel image contents, without any extra labels\nand without compromising quality of the synthesized high-resolution images. We\nfurther demonstrate several image generation and manipulation applications\nenabled or improved by BSD-GAN. Source codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/duxingren14/BSD-GAN.\n",

One promising platform to reach such\nstrong light-matter interacting regimes is offered by polaritonic metasurfaces,\nwhich represent ultrathin artificial media structured on nano-scale and\ndesigned to support polaritons - half-light half-matter quasiparticles.\nTopological polaritons, or 'topolaritons', offer an ideal platform in this\ncontext, with unique properties stemming from topological phases of light\nstrongly coupled with matter. Here we explore polaritonic metasurfaces based on\n2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) supporting in-plane polarized\nexciton resonances as a promising platform for topological polaritonics. We\nenable a spin-Hall topolaritonic phase by strongly coupling valley polarized\nin-plane excitons in a TMD monolayer with a suitably engineered all-dielectric\ntopological photonic metasurface. We first show that the strong coupling\nbetween topological photonic bands supported by the metasurface and excitonic\nbands in MoSe2 yields an effective phase winding and transition to a\ntopolaritonic spin-Hall state. We then experimentally realize this phenomenon\nand confirm the presence of one-way spin-polarized edge topolaritons. Combined\nwith the valley polarization in a MoSe2 monolayer, the proposed system enables\na new approach to engage the photonic angular momentum and valley degree of\nfreedom in TMDs, offering a promising platform for photonic/solid-state\ninterfaces for valleytronics and spintronics.\n",

For\nexample, for any monoidal comonad $G$ on a cocomplete closed monoidal category\n$\\mathscr{C}$, the forgetful functor $U : \\mathscr{C}^G\\to \\mathscr{C}$ is\ncomonadic when regarded as a morphism in $\\mathrm{Caten}$ between one-object\nbicategories.\n  We show that the forgetful pseudofunctor\n$\\mathscr{U}:\\mathscr{V}^\\mathscr{G}\\rightarrow \\mathscr{V}$ from the\nbicategory of Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for a comonad $\\mathscr{G}$ on\n$\\mathscr{V}$ in $\\mathrm{Caten}$ induces a change of base pseudofunctor\n$\\widetilde{\\mathscr{U}}:\\mathscr{V}^\\mathscr{G}\\text{-}\\mathrm{Mod}\\rightarrow\n\\mathscr{V}\\text{-}\\mathrm{Mod}$ which is comonadic in a bigger version of\n$\\mathrm{Caten}$. We define Hopfness for such a comonad $\\mathscr{G}$ and prove\nthat having that property implies $\\mathscr{U}$ creates left (Kan) extensions\nin the bicategory $\\mathscr{V}^\\mathscr{G}$. We provide conditions under which\nHopfness carries over from $\\mathscr{G}$ to the comonad\n$\\widetilde{\\mathscr{G}}=\\widetilde{\\mathscr{U}}\\circ \\widetilde{\\mathscr{R}}$\ngenerated by the adjunction $\\widetilde{\\mathscr{U}}\\dashv\n\\widetilde{\\mathscr{R}}$.

Here, a\nmatching of a given Stable Marriage or Stable Roommates instance is called\ncoalitional exchange-stable if it does not admit any exchange-blocking\ncoalition, that is, a subset S of agents in which everyone prefers the partner\nof some other agent in S. The matching is exchange-stable if it does not admit\nany exchange-blocking pair, that is, an exchange-blocking coalition of size\ntwo.\n  We investigate the computational and parameterized complexity of the\nCoalitional Exchange-Stable Marriage (resp. Coalitional Exchange Roommates)\nproblem, which is to decide whether a Stable Marriage (resp. Stable Roommates)\ninstance admits a coalitional exchange-stable matching. Our findings resolve an\nopen question and confirm the conjecture of Cechl\\'arov\\'a and Manlove\n[Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2005] that Coalitional Exchange-Stable Marriage\nis NP-hard even for complete preferences without ties. We also study\nbounded-length preference lists and a local-search variant of deciding whether\na given matching can reach an exchange-stable one after at most k swaps, where\na swap is defined as exchanging the partners of the two agents in an\nexchange-blocking pair.\n",

    "abstract": "  In modern rare isotope facilities, ion cooling and bunching lies at the heart\nof the ion transfer along a low-energy beam line that consists of several\ndifferential pumping stages. We present a conceptual design of an ion guide as\nan alternative to the conventional linear Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) for\ncooling and bunching rare isotopes. The ion guide is composed of stacked ring\nelectrodes of varying apertures, to which a confining RF potential following a\nrectangular waveform is applied. The thicknesses of the rings and the gaps in\nbetween are varied accordingly to maximize the confining volume and to reduce\nion losses. Ion transport within the ion guide is facilitated by a\nlower-frequency wave traveling on top of the higher-frequency confining field.\nThe former is induced by locally adjusting the duty cycle of the rectangular\nwaveform of the confining potential. Design parameters are first calculated by\nanalytical studies and then optimized by ion trajectory simulations with\nSIMION. The results show that the ion guide enables high ion transmission and\nproduces well focused ion bunches. It will be used in the NEXT project, an\nexperimental study of atomic masses of Neutron-rich EXotic nuclei produced in\nmulti-nucleon Transfer reactions.\n",

    "abstract": "  The jamming and percolation for two generalized models of random sequential\nadsorption (RSA) of linear $k$-mers (particles occupying $k$ adjacent sites) on\na square lattice are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The classical\nrandom sequential adsorption (RSA) model assumes the absence of overlapping of\nthe new incoming particle with the previously deposited ones. The first model\nLK$_d$ is a generalized variant of the RSA model for both $k$-mers and a\nlattice with defects. Some of the occupying $k$ adjacent sites are considered\nas insulating and some of the lattice sites are occupied by defects\n(impurities). For this model even a small concentration of defects can inhibit\npercolation for relatively long $k$-mers. The second model is the cooperative\nsequential adsorption (CSA) one, where, for each new $k$-mer, only a restricted\nnumber of lateral contacts $z$ with previously deposited $k$-mers is allowed.\nDeposition occurs in the case when $z\\leq (1-d)z_m$ where $z_m=2(k+1)$ is the\nmaximum numbers of the contacts of $k$-mer, and $d$ is the fraction of\nforbidden NN contacts. Percolation is observed only at some interval\n$k_{min}\\leq k\\leq k_{max}$ where the values $k_{min}$ and $k_{max}$ depend\nupon the fraction of forbidden contacts $d$. The value $k_{max}$ decreases as\n$d$ increases. A logarithmic dependence of the type $\\log(k_{max})=a+bd$, where\n$a=-4.03 \\pm 0.22$, $b=4.93 \\pm 0.57 $, is obtained.\n",

The exponent measure of an exchangeable minimum\ninfinitely divisible sequence is shown to be the sum of a very simple ``drift\nmeasure'' and a mixture of product probability measures, which uniquely\ncorresponds to the L\\'evy measure of a non-negative and non-decreasing\ninfinitely divisible process. The latter is shown to be supported on\nnon-negative and non-decreasing functions. In probabilistic terms, the\naforementioned infinitely divisible process is equal to the conditional\ncumulative hazard process associated with the exchangeable sequence of random\nvariables with minimum (or maximum) infinitely divisible marginals. Our results\nprovide an analytic umbrella which embeds the de Finetti subfamilies of many\ninteresting classes of multivariate distributions, such as exogenous shock\nmodels, exponential and geometric laws with lack-of-memory property, min-stable\nmultivariate exponential and extreme-value distributions, as well as reciprocal\nArchimedean copulas with completely monotone generator and Archimedean copulas\nwith log-completely monotone generator.\n",

    "abstract": "  Dispatch of a grid energy storage system for arbitrage is typically\nformulated into a rolling-horizon optimization problem that includes a battery\naging model within the cost function. Quantifying degradation as a depreciation\ncost in the objective can increase overall profits by extending lifetime.\nHowever, depreciation is just a proxy metric for battery aging; it is used\nbecause simulating the entire system life is challenging due to computational\ncomplexity and the absence of decades of future data. In cases where the\ndepreciation cost does not match the loss of possible future revenue, different\noptimal usage profiles result and this reduces overall profit significantly\ncompared to the best case (e.g., by 30-50%). Representing battery degradation\nperfectly within the rolling-horizon optimization does not resolve this - in\naddition, the economic cost of degradation throughout life should be carefully\nconsidered. For energy arbitrage, optimal economic dispatch requires a\ntrade-off between overuse, leading to high return rate but short lifetime, vs.\nunderuse, leading to a long but not profitable life. We reveal the intuition\nbehind selecting representative costs for the objective function, and propose a\nsimple moving average filter method to estimate degradation cost. Results show\nthat this better captures peak revenue, assuming reliable price forecasts are\navailable.\n",

    "abstract": "  Novel artificial intelligence (AI) technology has expedited various\nscientific research, e.g., cosmology, physics and bioinformatics, inevitably\nbecoming a significant category of workload on high performance computing (HPC)\nsystems. Existing AI benchmarks tend to customize well-recognized AI\napplications, so as to evaluate the AI performance of HPC systems under\npredefined problem size, in terms of datasets and AI models. Due to lack of\nscalability on the problem size, static AI benchmarks might be under competent\nto help understand the performance trend of evolving AI applications on HPC\nsystems, in particular, the scientific AI applications on large-scale systems.\n  In this paper, we propose a scalable evaluation methodology (SAIH) for\nanalyzing the AI performance trend of HPC systems with scaling the problem\nsizes of customized AI applications. To enable scalability, SAIH builds a set\nof novel mechanisms for augmenting problem sizes. As the data and model\nconstantly scale, we can investigate the trend and range of AI performance on\nHPC systems, and further diagnose system bottlenecks. To verify our\nmethodology, we augment a cosmological AI application to evaluate a real HPC\nsystem equipped with GPUs as a case study of SAIH.\n",

    "abstract": "  Elucidating and accurately predicting the druggability and bioactivities of\nmolecules plays a pivotal role in drug design and discovery and remains an open\nchallenge. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have made remarkable\nadvancements in graph-based molecular property prediction. However, current\ngraph-based deep learning methods neglect the hierarchical information of\nmolecules and the relationships between feature channels. In this study, we\npropose a well-designed hierarchical informative graph neural networks\nframework (termed HiGNN) for predicting molecular property by utilizing a\nco-representation learning of molecular graphs and chemically synthesizable\nBRICS fragments. Furthermore, a plug-and-play feature-wise attention block is\nfirst designed in HiGNN architecture to adaptively recalibrate atomic features\nafter the message passing phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGNN\nachieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on many challenging drug\ndiscovery-associated benchmark datasets. In addition, we devise a\nmolecule-fragment similarity mechanism to comprehensively investigate the\ninterpretability of HiGNN model at the subgraph level, indicating that HiGNN as\na powerful deep learning tool can help chemists and pharmacists identify the\nkey components of molecules for designing better molecules with desired\nproperties or functions.

    "abstract": "  Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study\nastrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires\nsubstantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific\ninformation from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and\nanalysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures\nas well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices\nare typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an\nunderstanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs\nbetween compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is\nconsidered \"best practice\". A metric of absolute correctness is not always\navailable and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying\nprinciples and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a\ngiven dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists.\nOur goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and\nnumerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these\nobjective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system\nthat is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing\ninterferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the\nprinciples behind interferometry and the procedures required for data\nprocessing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and\npropose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated\nand the results are discussed.\n",

Based on measurements performed on both bulk and\npowdered samples of Ru-1212 and Sr-2116, we exclude the possibility, that the\nobserved behavior of the magnetization of Ru-1212 is due to Sr-2116 impurities.\nThe effect is related to the superconductivity of Ru-1212, but it is not an\nintrinsic property of this compound. We provide evidence that the observation\nof magnetization peaks in the superconducting state of Ru-1212 is due to flux\nmotion generated by the movement of the sample in an inhomogeneous field,\nduring the measurement in the SQUID magnetometer.

    "abstract": "  Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays and charged cosmic rays (CCRs) provide an\nobservational window into the acceleration mechanisms of extreme astrophysical\nenvironments. One of the major challenges at Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes\n(IACTs) designed to look for VHE gamma rays, is the separation of air showers\ninitiated by CCRs which form a background to gamma ray searches. Two other less\nwell studied problems at IACTs are a) the classification of different primary\nnuclei among the CCR events and b) identification of anomalous events initiated\nby Beyond Standard Model particles that could give rise to shower signatures\nwhich differ from the standard images of either gamma rays or CCR showers. The\nproblems of categorizing the primary particle that initiates a shower image, or\nthe problem of tagging anomalous shower events in a model independent way, are\nproblems that are well suited to a machine learning (ML) approach. Traditional\nstudies that have explored gamma ray/CCR separation have used a multivariate\nanalysis based on derived shower properties, which contains significantly\nreduced information about the shower. In our work, we address the problems\noutlined above by using ML architectures trained on full simulated shower\nimages, as opposed to training on just a few derived shower properties. We\nillustrate the techniques of binary and multi-category classification using\nconvolutional neural networks, and we also pioneer the use of autoencoders for\nanomaly detection at VHE gamma ray experiments. As a case study, we apply our\ntechniques to the H.E.S.S. experiment. However, the real strength of the\ntechniques that we broach here in the context of VHE gamma ray observatories,\nis that these methods can be applied broadly to any other IACT, such as the\nupcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), or can even be suitably adapted to\nCCR experiments.\n",

    "abstract": "  The recent measurement of the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR\nJ1614-2230 yielded a mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun, making it the most massive\npulsar known to date. Its mass is high enough that, even without an\naccompanying measurement of the stellar radius, it has a strong impact on our\nunderstanding of nuclear matter, gamma-ray bursts, and the generation of\ngravitational waves from coalescing neutron stars. This single high mass value\nindicates that a transition to quark matter in neutron-star cores can occur at\ndensities comparable to the nuclear saturation density only if the quarks are\nstrongly interacting and are color superconducting. We further show that a high\nmaximum neutron-star mass is required if short duration gamma-ray bursts are\npowered by coalescing neutron stars and, therefore, this mechanism becomes\nviable in the light of the recent measurement. Finally, we argue that the\nlow-frequency (<= 500 Hz) gravitational waves emitted during the final stages\nof neutron-star coalescence encode the properties of the equation of state\nbecause neutron stars consistent with this measurement cannot be centrally\ncondensed. This will facilitate the measurement of the neutron star equation of\nstate with Advanced LIGO/Virgo.\n",

    "abstract": "  The ultimate realization of a global quantum internet will require advances\nin scalable technologies capable of generating, storing, and manipulating\nquantum information. The essential devices that will perform these tasks in a\nquantum network are quantum repeaters, which will enable the long-range\ndistribution of entanglement between distant network nodes. In this\nperspective, we provide an overview of the primary functions of a quantum\nrepeater and discuss progress that has been made toward the development of\nrepeaters with rare-earth ion doped materials while noting challenges that are\nbeing faced as the technologies mature. We give particular attention to erbium,\nwhich is well suited for networking applications. Finally, we provide a\ndiscussion of near-term benchmarks that can further guide rare-earth ion\nplatforms for impact in near-term quantum networks.\n",

    "abstract": "  A diverse representation of different demographic groups in AI training data\nsets is important in ensuring that the models will work for a large range of\nusers. To this end, recent efforts in AI fairness and inclusion have advocated\nfor creating AI data sets that are well-balanced across race, gender,\nsocioeconomic status, and disability status. In this paper, we contribute to\nthis line of work by focusing on the representation of age by asking whether\nolder adults are represented proportionally to the population at large in AI\ndata sets. We examine publicly-available information about 92 face data sets to\nunderstand how they codify age as a case study to investigate how the subjects'\nages are recorded and whether older generations are represented. We find that\nolder adults are very under-represented; five data sets in the study that\nexplicitly documented the closed age intervals of their subjects included older\nadults (defined as older than 65 years), while only one included oldest-old\nadults (defined as older than 85 years). Additionally, we find that only 24 of\nthe data sets include any age-related information in their documentation or\nmetadata, and that there is no consistent method followed across these data\nsets to collect and record the subjects' ages. We recognize the unique\ndifficulties in creating representative data sets in terms of age, but raise it\nas an important dimension that researchers and engineers interested in\ninclusive AI should consider.\n",

Unexpected spin torques were\ninduced on dimers when illuminated with linearly polarized plane-waves. As\nnear-field observables, the spectra of torques showed more resolved resonances\nthan typical far-field spectra. Here the study is extended to silicon dimers.\nStrong forces and torques are exerted by light under both polarizations s and\np, contrary to plasmonic systems where the resonant strong forces are found\nonly for p-polarization. The systems made of high-dielectric possess volume\nresonances that induce the forces differently than in plasmonic systems, which\nhave surface resonances. The asymmetry in strong near-fields is responsible for\nthe unusual mechanics of the system. Some consequences of that may include the\nbreaking of the action-reaction principle or the appearance of pulling forces.\n  The numerical study is based on an exact method. The work is thought for the\ndesign of nanorotators and nanodetectors. It suggests a new viewpoint about\noptical forces: the resultant dynamics of topological variations of\nelectromagnetic fields.\n",

The ISOC problem aims at determining\nthe cost function and noise scaling matrices of the LQS model from measurement\ndata since both parameter types influence the statistical moments predicted by\nthe model and are unknown in practice. We prove global convergence for our new\nalgorithm and at a numerical example, validate the theoretical assumptions of\nour method.

    "abstract": "  Recently we introduced a local photon approach for modelling the quantised\nelectromagnetic field in position space. Using this approach, we define the\nmomentum of light in this paper as in quantum mechanics as the generator for\nspatial translation. Afterwards, we analyse the momentum dynamics of photonic\nwave packets which transition from air into a denser dielectric medium. Our\nanalysis shines new light onto the Abraham-Minkowski controversy which\nhighlights the intricacies involved in the characterisation of the momentum of\nthe electromagnetic field. Although our results align with Minkowski's theory\nand with the definition of the canonical momentum of light in quantum\nelectrodynamics, there are also some crucial differences.\n",

    "abstract": "  We have mapped the central region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 1097 in\n12CO(J=2-1) with the Submillieter Array (SMA). The 12CO(J=2-1) map shows a\ncentral concentration and a surrounding ring, which coincide respectively with\nthe Seyfert nucleus and a starburst ring. The line intensity peaks at the\nnucleus, whereas in a previously published 12CO(J=1-0) map the intensity peaks\nat the starburst ring. The molecular ring has an azimuthally averaged\n12CO(J=2-1)/(J=1-0) intensity ratio (R21) of about unity, which is similar to\nthose in nearby active star forming galaxies, suggesting that most of the\nmolecular mass in the ring is involved in fueling the starburst. The molecular\ngas can last for only about 1.2\\times10^8 years without further replenishment\nassuming a constant star formation rate and a perfect conversion of gas to\nstars. The velocity map shows that the central molecular gas is rotating with\nthe molecular ring in the same direction, while its velocity gradient is much\nsteeper than that of the ring. This velocity gradient of the central gas is\nsimilar to what is usually observed in some Seyfert 2 galaxies. To view the\nactive nucleus directly in the optical, the central molecular gas structure can\neither be a low-inclined disk or torus but not too low to be less massive than\nthe mass of the host galaxy itself, be a highly-inclined thin disk or clumpy\nand thick torus, or be an inner part of the galactic disk. The R21 value of\n~1.9 of the central molecular gas component, which is significantly higher than\nthe value found at the molecular gas ring, indicates that the activity of the\nSeyfert nucleus may have a significant influence on the conditions of the\nmolecular gas in the central component.\n",

    "abstract": "  Previously the linearized stress tensor of a stationary Kerr black hole has\nbeen used to determine some of the values of gravitational couplings for a\nspinning black hole to linear order in the Riemann tensor in the action\n(worldline or quantum field theory). In particular, the couplings on operators\ncontaining derivative structures of the form $(S\\cdot\\nabla)^n$ acting on the\nRiemann tensor were fixed, with $S^\\mu$ the spin vector of the black hole. In\nthis paper we find that the Kerr solution determines all of the multipole\nmoments in the sense of Dixon of a stationary spinning black hole and that\nthese multipole moments determine all linear in $R$ couplings. For example,\nadditional couplings beyond the previously mentioned are fixed on operators\ncontaining derivative structures of the form $S^{2n}(p\\cdot\\nabla)^{2n}$ acting\non the Riemann tensor with $p^\\mu$ the momentum vector of the black hole. These\nadditional operators do not contribute to the three-point amplitude, and so do\nno contribute to the linearized stress tensor for a stationary black hole.\nHowever, we find that they do contribute to the Compton amplitude.\nAdditionally, we derive formal expressions for the electromagnetic and\ngravitational Compton amplitudes of generic spinning bodies to all orders in\nspin in the worldline formalism and evaluated expressions for these amplitudes\nto order $S^3$ in electromagnetism and order $S^5$ in gravity.\n",

Then, to infer underlying black\nhole and accretion flow parameters (spin, inclination, ion-to-electron\ntemperature ratio, and magnetic field polarity), we train a random forest\nmachine learning model on various hand-picked polarimetric observables computed\nfrom each image. Our random forest is capable of making meaningful predictions\nof spin, inclination, and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio, but has more\ndifficulty inferring magnetic field polarity. To disentangle how physical\nparameters are encoded in different observables, we apply two different metrics\nto rank the importance of each observable at inferring each physical parameter.\nDetails of the spatially resolved linear polarization morphology stand out as\nimportant discriminators between models. Bearing in mind the theoretical\nlimitations and incompleteness of our image library, for the real M87* data,\nour machinery favours high-spin retrograde models with large ion-to-electron\ntemperature ratios. Due to the time-variable nature of these targets, repeated\npolarimetric imaging will further improve model inference as the EHT and\nnext-generation (EHT) continue to develop and monitor their targets.\n",

We find that the oscillatory\nsignal in the frequencies caused by the depression in \\Gamma_1 in the second\nhelium ionisation zone can be used to determine the envelope helium abundance\nof low mass main sequence stars. For frequency errors of 1 part in 10^4, we\nexpect errors \\sigma_Y in the estimated helium abundance to range from 0.03 for\n0.8M_sun stars to 0.01 for 1.2M_sun stars. The task is more complicated in\nevolved stars, such as subgiants, but is still feasible if the relative errors\nin the frequencies are less than 10^{-4}.\n",

In this paper, we provide a fully time-dependent\nnumerical solution to the radiative transfer and atomic rate equations for a\nmedium irradiated by an external source of photons. We use Accelerated Lambda\nIteration to achieve convergence of the radiation field and atomic states. We\nperform calculations for a three-level atomic model that illustrates important\ntime-dependent effects. We demonstrate that our method provides an efficient,\naccurate solution to the time-dependent radiative transfer problem.

In this paper, we investigate the storage of optical pulses as\ncollective Rydberg atomic excitations in a cold atomic ensemble. By measuring\nthe dynamics of the stored Rydberg polaritons, we experimentally demonstrate\nthat storing a probe pulse as Rydberg polaritons strongly enhances the Rydberg\nmediated interaction compared to the slow propagation case. We show that the\nprocess is characterized by two time scales. At short storage times, we observe\na strong enhancement of the interaction due to the reduction of the Rydberg\npolariton group velocity down to zero. For longer storage times, we observe a\nfurther, weaker enhancement dominated by Rydberg induced dephasing of the\nmultiparticle components of the state. In this regime, we observe a non-linear\ndependence of the Rydberg polariton coherence time with the input photon\nnumber. Our results have direct consequences in Rydberg quantum optics and\nenable the test of new theories of strongly interacting Rydberg systems.\n",

We firmly\nbelieve that this same approach can be used when solving problems of\ncorrelation between structural and spectral metrics in complex networks. So,\nwhat we want to point out is about the possibility of applying one theory of\nnetworks (the theory of k-geodetic networks) to the solution of problems in\nanother type of networks (complex networks). The theory of geodetic graphs and\ntheir various modifications represents an important tool for the structural\nanalysis of complex systems of transmission, processing, and analysis of\ninformation. In the case of large data sets, their stochastic dependence is\ndescribed by large-dimensional correlation matrices. One of the problems of\ncorrelation analysis is the study of the structure of the correlation matrix.\nIt is proved that such a structure is adequately described by geodetic graphs.\nThe obtained structural data allow solving the choice problem of significant\nvariables in multidimensional regression models.\n",

    "abstract": "  CHROMIS, a new imaging spectrometer at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST),\ncan observe the chromosphere in the H and K lines of Ca II at high spatial and\nspectral resolution. Accurate modeling as well as an understanding of the\nformation of these lines are needed to interpret the SST/CHROMIS observations.\nSuch modeling is computationally challenging because these lines are influenced\nby strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium, three-dimensional\nradiative transfer, and partially coherent resonance scattering of photons. We\naim to model the CaII H&K lines in 3D model atmospheres to understand their\nformation and to investigate their diagnostic potential for probing the\nchromosphere. We model the synthetic spectrum of Ca II using the radiative\ntransfer code Multi3D in three different radiation-magnetohydrodynamic model\natmospheres computed with the Bifrost code. We classify synthetic intensity\nprofiles according to their shapes and study how their features are related to\nthe physical properties in the model atmospheres. We investigate whether the\nsynthetic data reproduce the observed spatially-averaged line shapes,\ncenter-to-limb variation and compare with SST/CHROMIS images. The\nspatially-averaged synthetic line profiles show too low central emission peaks,\nand too small separation between the peaks. The trends of the observed\ncenter-to-limb variation of the profiles properties are reproduced by the\nmodels. The Ca II H&K line profiles provide a temperature diagnostic of the\ntemperature minimum and the temperature at the formation height of the emission\npeaks. The Doppler shift of the central depression is an excellent probe of the\nvelocity in the upper chromosphere.\n",

    "abstract": "  Context: Star clusters, composed of stars born from the same molecular cloud,\nserve as invaluable natural laboratories for understanding the fundamental\nprocesses governing stellar formation and evolution. Aims: This study aims to\ninvestigate correlations between the Mean Interdistance ($\\bar{D_{i}}$), Mean\nClosest Interdistance ($\\bar{D_{c}}$) and Median Weighted Central Interdistance\n($\\bar{D_{cc}}$) with the age of star clusters, examining their evolutionary\ntrends and assessing the robustness of these quantities as possible age\nindicators. Methods: We selected a sample of open clusters in the solar region\nand with a representative number of members (e.g. well populated and without\noutliers). The interdistances are derived from the spatial distribution of\nmember stars within a cluster. Their evolution over time allows us to use them\nas an age indicators for star clusters. Results: Our investigation reveals a\nhigh-significant correlation between the interdistances and cluster age.\nConsidering the full sample of clusters between 7 and 9 kpc, the relationship\nis very broad. This is due to uncertainties in parallax, which increase with\nincreasing distance. In particular, we must limit the sample to a maximum\ndistance from the Sun of about 200 pc to avoid artificial effects on cluster\nshape and on the spatial distribution of their stars along the line of sight.\nConclusions: By conservatively restraining the distance to a maximum of\n$\\sim$200 pc, we have established a relationship between the interdistances and\nthe age of the clusters. In our sample, the relationship is mainly driven by\nthe internal expansion of the clusters, and is marginally affected by external\nperturbative effects. Such relation might enhance our comprehension of cluster\ndynamics and might be used to derive cluster dynamical ages.\n",

    "abstract": "  Current social and activist movements find the opportunity in social media to\neffectively impact on the agenda of governing bodies and create `global'\nperceptions -- it is often claimed. Content related to the social and activist\nmovements is online, to be accessed, supported or disputed and distributed from\nvirtually anywhere at any time, in the public sphere of the Internet. This\nactivity allows the enlargement of social movements and would increase the\nempowerment in the concerned communities. The aim of this explorative study is\nto assess whether the temporal evolution of the Normalised Web Distance (NWD)\n--as defined by Cilibrasi & Vit\\'anyi (2007)-- between identifying terms\nconcerning this activism could be used to measure the progress or decline of\nsocial empowerment through the Internet. The NWD relies on the page count\nnumber of single and joint queries, which in our study have been registered\nusing a freely available web browser (e.g. Google Search) providing a time\nsearch window for temporal query results. To explore this meta-data technique,\nwe introduce the case of a perceived Wirikuta online movement, which originated\nin Mexico with the aim to protect the Huichols' sacred land and water resources\nfrom open mining projects for silver ore. We conducted a small scale Internet\nstudy relating the key terms `Wirikuta', `Huichol', and `Wixarika' and their\nco-occurrence with seven positive qualifiers (e.g. `sacred land'), five\nnegative qualifiers (e.g. `violence') and one neutral qualifier (`table') over\ntime, annually from 1994 till 2013. We confirm close semantic clustering over\ntime of traditional indigeneous identity terms of the Huichol, and observe a\nslight convergence of key terms to `mines' and less pronounced to `sacred land'\nand a divergence with respect to `ancestors' indicating a complex image of a\ntendency of empowerment.\n",

    "abstract": "  Vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum are extensively studied owing\nto its potential to expand channel capacity of microwave and optical\ncommunication. By utilizing the Pancharatnam-Berry phase concept, an\nultra-wideband single layer metasurface is proposed to realize the conversion\nfrom incident plane waves to reflected vortex beams covering a considerable\nbandwidth from 6.75 to 21.85 GHz . An equivalent circuit model combined with\nbroadband phase shift network is developed to effectively design the meta-atoms\nin metasurface. It is the first time to design wideband metasurfaces with the\nphase-based characteristics. To verify the proposed model, some deformed square\nloop meta-atoms are proposed to construct the metasurfaces with broadband OAM\ncharacteristic. Moreover, the vortex beams with the integer (l = -3),\nfractional (l = -1.5), and high-order (l = -10) OAM mode are generated\nrespectively. Based on an OAM spectral analysis, the mode purity of the\ngenerated vortex waves is discussed in detail. The experimental results achieve\na good agreement with those obtained from the simulation, thus proving the\neffectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.\n",

The associated Higgs, which generates the\n$Z'$'s mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) can mix with the SM Higgs.\nThe new parameters relating to extra Higgs cannot be probed at the LHC with\nfinal states containing no more than $4$ leptons. Therefore, we use signatures\nwith at least $6$ leptons to probe the parameter space through LHC experiments.\nSince SM predicts a lower cross section for a final state with at least $6$\nleptons than is currently visible at the LHC, the background is negligible,\nthereby making this channel an extremely sensitive probe. We find that in a\nlimited region of the parameter space this channel can strongly constrain the\nassociated $U(1)_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$ coupling constant, even more so than for a $4$\nlepton or fewer final state.\n",

    "abstract": "  Decentralized optimization is an emerging paradigm in distributed learning in\nwhich agents achieve network-wide solutions by peer-to-peer communication\nwithout the central server. Since communication tends to be slower than\ncomputation, when each agent communicates with only a few neighboring agents\nper iteration, they can complete iterations faster than with more agents or a\ncentral server. However, the total number of iterations to reach a network-wide\nsolution is affected by the speed at which the agents' information is ``mixed''\nby communication. We found that popular communication topologies either have\nlarge maximum degrees (such as stars and complete graphs) or are ineffective at\nmixing information (such as rings and grids). To address this problem, we\npropose a new family of topologies, EquiTopo, which has an (almost) constant\ndegree and a network-size-independent consensus rate that is used to measure\nthe mixing efficiency.\n  In the proposed family, EquiStatic has a degree of $\\Theta(\\ln(n))$, where\n$n$ is the network size, and a series of time-dependent one-peer topologies,\nEquiDyn, has a constant degree of 1. We generate EquiDyn through a certain\nrandom sampling procedure. Both of them achieve an $n$-independent consensus\nrate. We apply them to decentralized SGD and decentralized gradient tracking\nand obtain faster communication and better convergence, theoretically and\nempirically. Our code is implemented through BlueFog and available at\n\\url{https://github.com/kexinjinnn/EquiTopo}\n",

    "abstract": "  Corrigibility of autonomous agents is an under explored part of system\ndesign, with previous work focusing on single agent systems. It has been\nsuggested that uncertainty over the human preferences acts to keep the agents\ncorrigible, even in the face of human irrationality. We present a general\nframework for modelling corrigibility in a multi-agent setting as a 2 player\ngame in which the agents always have a move in which they can ask the human for\nsupervision. This is formulated as a Bayesian game for the purpose of\nintroducing uncertainty over the human beliefs. We further analyse two specific\ncases. First, a two player corrigibility game, in which we want corrigibility\ndisplayed in both agents for both common payoff (monotone) games and harmonic\ngames. Then we investigate an adversary setting, in which one agent is\nconsidered to be a `defending' agent and the other an `adversary'. A general\nresult is provided for what belief over the games and human rationality the\ndefending agent is required to have to induce corrigibility.\n",

The first\nand last five monomers of the chain have been allowed to pair and form the stem\nof the hairpin structure while the remaining monomers can form a loop. The\ncoil-hairpin transition is found to be first order with large entropy change.\nWhile the rate of unzipping of the hairpin stem is found to be independent of\nthe length of the loop and the dimensionality of the space, the rate of closing\nvaries greatly with loop length and dimensionality of the space.\n",

They satisfy an algebra and\nin four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of an\n$SU(4)$ flavor symmetry which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered\nfermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum\nlimit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global\nparameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation\nsymmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To\nmaintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher\nform lattice gauge fields. An analogous procedure can be carried out for\nreduced staggered fermions where the shifts correspond to a discrete subgroup\nof an $SO(4)$ flavor symmetry.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a time-dependent radiative model of the atmosphere of HD209458b\nand investigate its thermal structure and chemical composition. In a first\nstep, the stellar heating profile and radiative timescales were calculated\nunder planet-averaged insolation conditions. We find that 99.99% of the\nincoming stellar flux has been absorbed before reaching the 7 bar level.\nStellar photons cannot therefore penetrate deeply enough to explain the large\nradius of the planet. We derive a radiative time constant which increases with\ndepth and reaches about 8 hr at 0.1 bar and 2.3 days at 1 bar. Time-dependent\ntemperature profiles were also calculated, in the limit of a zonal wind that is\nindependent on height (i.e. solid-body rotation) and constant absorption\ncoefficients. We predict day-night variations of the effective temperature of\n\\~600 K, for an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s, in good agreement with the\npredictions by Showman &Guillot (2002). This rotation rate yields day-to-night\ntemperature variations in excess of 600 K above the 0.1-bar level. These\nvariations rapidly decrease with depth below the 1-bar level and become\nnegligible below the ~5--bar level for rotation rates of at least 0.5 km/s. At\nhigh altitudes (mbar pressures or less), the night temperatures are low enough\nto allow sodium to condense into Na2S. Synthetic transit spectra of the visible\nNa doublet show a much weaker sodium absorption on the morning limb than on the\nevening limb. The calculated dimming of the sodium feature during planetary\ntransites agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al. (2002).\n",

We describe how next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak\ncorrections are combined with the NLO QCD calculation, and show how they are\ninterfaced to QCD and QED shower Monte Carlo. The resulting tool fills a gap in\nthe literature and allows to study comprehensively the interplay of QCD and\nelectroweak effects to W production using a single computational framework.\nNumerical comparisons with the predictions of the electroweak generator HORACE,\nas well as with existing results on the combination of electroweak and QCD\ncorrections to W production, are shown for the LHC energies, to validate the\nreliability and accuracy of the approach\n",

    "abstract": "  Glitches are rare spin-up events that punctuate the smooth slow-down of the\nrotation of pulsars. For the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, the glitch sizes\nand the times between consecutive events have clear preferred scales, contrary\nto the handful of other pulsars with enough glitches for such a study.\nMoreover, PSR J0537-6910 is the only pulsar showing a strong positive\ncorrelation between the size of each glitch and the waiting time until the\nfollowing one.\n  We attempt to understand this behavior through a detailed study of the\ndistributions and correlations of glitch properties for the eight pulsars with\nat least ten detected glitches. We model the distributions of glitch sizes and\ntimes between consecutive glitches for this sample and perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations to explore two hypotheses that could explain why the correlation is\nso much weaker in other pulsars than in PSR J0537-6910.\n  We confirm the above results for the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, and\nverify that the latter is the only pulsar with a strong correlation between\nglitch size and waiting time to the following glitch. For the remaining six\npulsars, the waiting time distributions are best fitted by exponentials, and\nthe size distributions either by power laws, exponentials, or log-normal\nfunctions. Some pulsars in the sample yield significant Pearson and Spearman\ncoefficients ($r_p$ and $r_s$) for the aforementioned correlation. Moreover,\nfor all except the Crab, both coefficients are positive. Our simulations show\nthat the weaker correlations in pulsars other than PSR J0537$-$6910 cannot be\ndue to missing glitches too small to be detected. We also tested the hypothesis\nthat each pulsar may have two kinds of glitches, namely large, correlated ones\nand small, uncorrelated ones. We found for all pulsars that their glitches are\nnot consistent with a pure uncorrelated population either.\n",

    "abstract": "  Recently, many studies have demonstrated deep neural network (DNN)\nclassifiers can be fooled by the adversarial example, which is crafted via\nintroducing some perturbations into an original sample. Accordingly, some\npowerful defense techniques were proposed. However, existing defense techniques\noften require modifying the target model or depend on the prior knowledge of\nattacks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for detecting\nadversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified\noff-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of\nnoise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar\nquantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image\nentropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for\ndifferent kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be\neffectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample\nand its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks.\nMore than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models\nare used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different\nattack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a\nhigh overall F1 score of 96.39% and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware\nattacks.\n",

    "abstract": "  While deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents outperform humans on an\nincreasing number of tasks, training them requires data equivalent to decades\nof human gameplay. Recent hierarchical RL methods have increased sample\nefficiency by incorporating information inherent to the structure of the\ndecision problem but at the cost of having to discover or use human-annotated\nsub-goals that guide the learning process. We show that intentions of human\nplayers, i.e. the precursor of goal-oriented decisions, can be robustly\npredicted from eye gaze even for the long-horizon sparse rewards task of\nMontezuma's Revenge - one of the most challenging RL tasks in the Atari2600\ngame suite. We propose Int-HRL: Hierarchical RL with intention-based sub-goals\nthat are inferred from human eye gaze. Our novel sub-goal extraction pipeline\nis fully automatic and replaces the need for manual sub-goal annotation by\nhuman experts. Our evaluations show that replacing hand-crafted sub-goals with\nautomatically extracted intentions leads to a HRL agent that is significantly\nmore sample efficient than previous methods.\n",

In optics, the photonic\nmoir\\'e lattice has many appealing properties such as its ability to localize\nlight, thus attracting much attention on exploring features of such a\nstructure. One fundamental research area for photonic moir\\'e lattices is the\nproperties of eigenstates, particularly the existence of localized eigenstates\nand the localization-to-delocalization transition in the energy band structure.\nHere we propose an accurate algorithm for the eigenproblems of aperiodic\nsystems by combining plane wave discretization and spectral indicator\nvalidation under the higher-dimensional projection, allowing us to explore\nenergy bands of fully aperiodic systems. A localization-delocalization\ntransition regarding the intensity of the aperiodic potential is observed and a\nnovel Pythagoras superposition principle for localized eigenstates of 2D\nmoir\\'e lattices is revealed by analyzing the relationship between the\naperiodic and its corresponding periodic eigenstates. This principle sheds\nlight on exploring the physics of localizations for moir\\'e lattice.\n",

    "abstract": "  Collaborative 3D object detection exploits information exchange among\nmultiple agents to enhance accuracy of object detection in presence of sensor\nimpairments such as occlusion. However, in practice, pose estimation errors due\nto imperfect localization would cause spatial message misalignment and\nsignificantly reduce the performance of collaboration. To alleviate adverse\nimpacts of pose errors, we propose CoAlign, a novel hybrid collaboration\nframework that is robust to unknown pose errors. The proposed solution relies\non a novel agent-object pose graph modeling to enhance pose consistency among\ncollaborating agents. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale data fusion strategy\nto aggregate intermediate features at multiple spatial resolutions. Comparing\nwith previous works, which require ground-truth pose for training supervision,\nour proposed CoAlign is more practical since it doesn't require any\nground-truth pose supervision in the training and makes no specific assumptions\non pose errors. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method is carried out on\nmultiple datasets, certifying that CoAlign significantly reduce relative\nlocalization error and achieving the state of art detection performance when\npose errors exist. Code are made available for the use of the research\ncommunity at https://github.com/yifanlu0227/CoAlign.\n",

For a given 3-manifold M it is defined as the\nsmallest volume of the complement of a (possibly empty) hyperbolic link in M.\nVarious refinements of this invariant are given, asymptotically tight upper and\nlower bounds are determined, and all non-hyperbolic closed 3-manifolds with\ntopological volume of at most 3.07 are classified. Moreover, it is shown that\nfor all but finitely many lens spaces, the volume minimiser is obtained by Dehn\nfilling one of the cusps of the complement of the Whitehead link or its sister\nmanifold.\n",

    "abstract": "  Nowadays an increasing amount of data is available and we have to deal with\nmodels in high dimension (number of covariates much larger than the sample\nsize). Under sparsity assumption it is reasonable to hope that we can make a\ngood estimation of the regression parameter. This sparsity assumption as well\nas a block structuration of the covariates into groups with similar modes of\nbehavior is for example quite natural in genomics. A huge amount of scientific\nliterature exists for Gaussian linear models including the Lasso estimator and\nalso the Group Lasso estimator which promotes group sparsity under an a priori\nknowledge of the groups. We extend this Group Lasso procedure to generalized\nlinear models and we study the properties of this estimator for sparse\nhigh-dimensional generalized linear models to find convergence rates. We\nprovide oracle inequalities for the prediction and estimation error under\nassumptions on the covariables and under a condition on the design matrix. We\nshow the ability of this estimator to recover good sparse approximation of the\ntrue model. At last we extend these results to the case of an Elastic net\npenalty and we apply them to the so-called Poisson regression case which has\nnot been studied in this context contrary to the logistic regression.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper presents a highly speculative model encompassing the cortex,\nthalamus, and hippocampus of the mammalian brain. While the majority of\ncomputational neuroscience models are founded upon empirical evidence, this\nmodel is predicated upon a hardware proposal for a machine learning\naccelerator. Such a device was designed to perform a specific task, such as\nspeech recognition. The design process employed the principles and techniques\ntypically used by computer architects in the design of devices such as\nprocessors. However, it also sought to maintain plausibility with biological\nsystems in accordance with the current understanding of the mammalian brain. In\nthe course of our research, we have identified a functional framework that may\nhelp to fill the gaps in current neuroscience, thereby facilitating the\nexplanations for many elusive cognitive-level effects. This paper does not\ndescribe the device itself or the rationale behind the design decision, but\ninstead, it presents a concise description of the derived model. In brief, the\nmodel provides a functional definition of the cortical column and its\nstructural definition by the minicolumns. It also offers a descriptive model\nfor the corticothalamic and corticostriatal loops, a functional proposal for\nthe hippocampal complex, and a simplified view of the brainstem circuitry\ninvolved in auditory processing. The proposed model appears to provide an\nexplanation for a number of cognitive phenomena, including some ERP effects,\nbottom-up and top-down attention, and the relationship between phenomena such\nas the cocktail party effect, anterograde and retrograde amnesia following\nhippocampal complex damage, and so forth.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a new practical power allocation technique based on\nbit error probability (BEP) for physical layer security systems. It is shown\nthat the secrecy rate that is the most commonly used in physical layer security\nsystems, cannot be a suitable criterion lonely. Large positive values are\nsuitable for the secrecy rate in physical layer security, but it does not\nconsider the performance of the legitimate and adversary users. In this paper,\nwe consider and analyze BEP for physical layer security systems because based\non it, the performance of the legitimate and adversary users are guaranteed and\nit is needed to use lower power. BEP is calculated for the legitimate and\nadversary users and it is shown that BEP can be better criterion for\nperformance evaluation of the physical layer security systems. Based on BEP,\nthe optimum transmit power is obtained and a new definition for outage\nprobability is proposed and obtained theoretically. Also, the proposed approach\nis applied for adversary users with unknown mode and the cooperative adversary\nusers. Simulation results show that the proposed method needs more than 5dB\nlower power for different scenarios.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a completely unbiased and controlled numerical method to solve\nquantum impurity problems in d-dimensional lattices. This approach is based on\na canonical transformation, of the Lanczos form, where the complete lattice\nHamiltonian is exactly mapped onto an equivalent one dimensional system, in the\nsame spirit as Wilson's numerical renormalization. The method is particularly\nsuited to study systems that are inhomogeneous, and/or have a boundary. As a\nproof of concept, we use the density matrix renormalization group to solve the\nequivalent one-dimensional problem. The resulting dimensional reduction\ntranslates into a reduction of the scaling of the entanglement entropy by a\nfactor $L^{d-1}$, where L is the linear dimension of the original d-dimensional\nlattice. This allows one to calculate the ground state of a magnetic impurity\nattached to an LxL square lattice and an LxLxL cubic lattice with L up to 140\nsites. We also study the localized edge states in graphene nanoribbons by\nattaching a magnetic impurity to the edge or the center of the system. For\narmchair metallic nanoribbons we find a slow decay of the spin correlations as\na consequence of the delocalized metallic states. In the case of zigzag\nribbons, the decay of the spin correlations depends on the position of the\nimpurity. If the impurity is situated in the bulk of the ribbon, the decay is\nslow as in the metallic case. On the other hand, if the adatom is attached to\nthe edge, the decay is fast, within few sites of the impurity, as a consequence\nof the localized edge states, and the short correlation length. The mapping can\nbe combined with ab-initio band structure calculations to model the system, and\nto understand correlation effects in quantum impurity problems from first\nprinciples.\n",

We train the components jointly and in a manner consistent with\nthe inference conditions. To generate chunked training data, we propose a\nmethod that utilizes word alignment while also preserving enough context. We\ncompare models with bidirectional and unidirectional encoders of different\ndepths, both on real speech and text input.

    "abstract": "  Large pre-trained language models are capable of generating varied and fluent\ntexts. Starting from the prompt, these models generate a narrative that can\ndevelop unpredictably. The existing methods of controllable text generation,\nwhich guide the narrative in the text in the user-specified direction, require\ncreating a training corpus and an additional time-consuming training procedure.\nThe paper proposes and investigates Collocation2Text, a plug-and-play method\nfor automatic controllable text generation in Russian, which does not require\nfine-tuning. The method is based on two interacting models: the autoregressive\nlanguage ruGPT-3 model and the autoencoding language ruRoBERTa model. The idea\nof the method is to shift the output distribution of the autoregressive model\naccording to the output distribution of the autoencoding model in order to\nensure a coherent transition of the narrative in the text towards the guide\nphrase, which can contain single words or collocations. The autoencoding model,\nwhich is able to take into account the left and right contexts of the token,\n\"tells\" the autoregressive model which tokens are the most and least logical at\nthe current generation step, increasing or decreasing the probabilities of the\ncorresponding tokens. The experiments on generating news articles using the\nproposed method showed its effectiveness for automatically generated fluent\ntexts which contain coherent transitions between user-specified phrases.\n",

To make the problem even more difficult (and interesting), neutrinos\ncan experience collective oscillations through nonlinear refraction in the\ndense neutrino medium in this environment. Significant progress has been made\nin the last decade towards the understanding of collective neutrino\noscillations in various simplified neutrino gas models with imposed symmetries\nand reduced dimensions. However, a series of recent studies seem to have\n\"reset\" this progress by showing that these models may not be compatible with\ncollective neutrino oscillations because the latter can break the symmetries\nspontaneously if they are not imposed. We review some of the key concepts of\ncollective neutrino oscillations by using a few simple toy models. We also\nelucidate the breaking of spatial and directional symmetries in these models\nbecause of collective oscillations.\n",

In this paper, we present an introduction to the ACS\nVirgo Cluster Survey: a program to image, in the F475W and F850LP bandpasses\n(Sloan g and z), 100 early-type galaxies in the Virgo Cluster using the\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. We describe the\nselection of the program galaxies and their ensemble properties, the choice of\nfilters, the field placement and orientation, the limiting magnitudes of the\nsurvey, coordinated parallel observations of 100 \"intergalactic\" fields with\nWFPC2, and supporting ground-based spectroscopic observations of the program\ngalaxies. In terms of depth, spatial resolution, sample size and homogeneity,\nthis represents the most comprehensive imaging survey to date of early-type\ngalaxies in a cluster environment. We briefly describe the main scientific\ngoals of the survey which include the measurement of luminosities,\nmetallicities, ages, and structural parameters for the many thousands of\nglobular clusters associated with these galaxies, a high-resolution isophotal\nanalysis of galaxies spanning a factor of ~ 450 in luminosity and sharing a\ncommon environment, the measurement of accurate distances for the full sample\nof galaxies using the method of surface brightness fluctuations, and a\ndetermination of the three-dimensional structure of Virgo itself.\n",

Preliminary simulation results\ndemonstrate the application potential of the modified vis-viva equation for\nmore complex n-body systems.

The acoustic model is fine-tuned with a few\nsamples of the target speaker to realize voice cloning. This system can\ngenerate speech of arbitrary utterance of target language in cross-lingual\nspeakers' voice.

Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of\ntraining and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples,\nnamed pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from\nreal samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the\nfidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation,\nenabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common\nor more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference\nto enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning\nwith importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an\nadjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore,\nour fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal\niterations.\n",

In addition to their use in speech technology applications\nsuch as spoken term discovery and keyword spotting, AWE models have been\nadopted as models of spoken-word processing in several cognitively motivated\nstudies and have been shown to exhibit human-like performance in some auditory\nprocessing tasks. Nevertheless, the representational geometry of AWEs remains\nan under-explored topic that has not been studied in the literature. In this\npaper, we take a closer analytical look at AWEs learned from English speech and\nstudy how the choice of the learning objective and the architecture shapes\ntheir representational profile. To this end, we employ a set of analytic\ntechniques from machine learning and neuroscience in three different analyses:\nembedding space uniformity, word discriminability, and representational\nconsistency. Our main findings highlight the prominent role of the learning\nobjective on shaping the representation profile compared to the model\narchitecture.\n",

In the case that Y = X/G is\na quotient stack, our results provide a higher categorical analogue of the\nAtiyah-Bott--Kirwan--Ness \"equivariant perfection of Morse theory'' for the\nnorm-squared of a real moment map. As a consequence, we deduce a modified form\nof Kirwan surjectivity for the cohomology of hyperkaehler/algebraic symplectic\nquotients of cotangent bundles.\n",

    "abstract": "  The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles,\nfacilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental\nphysics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally\nobserved that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under\nMarkovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we\ntheoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear\nspins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we\ndemonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak\nmagnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian\nnoise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal\nexperimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the\ncombination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the\namplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable\nguidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark\nmatter and exotic interactions in the near future.\n",

    "abstract": "  We examine the Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, encompassing\n~736 d at 1 min cadence. During this span each system exhibited ~64-65\noutbursts, including six superoutbursts. We find that, in both systems, the\nnormal outbursts between two superoutbursts increase in duration over time by a\nfactor ~1.2-1.9, and then reset to a small value after the following\nsuperoutburst. In both systems the trend of quiescent intervals between normal\noutbursts is to increase to a local maximum about half way through the\nsupercycle - the interval from one superoutburst to the next - and then to\ndecrease back to a small value by the time of the next superoutburst. This is\ninconsistent with Osaki's thermal-tidal model, which predicts a monotonic\nincrease in the quiescent intervals between normal outbursts during a\nsupercycle. Also, most of the normal outbursts have an asymmetric,\nfast-rise/slower-decline shape, consistent with outbursts triggered at large\nradii. The exponential rate of decay of the plateau phase of the superoutbursts\nis 8 d/mag for V1504 Cyg and 12 d/mag for V344 Lyr. This time scale gives a\ndirect measure of the viscous time scale in the outer accretion disk given the\nexpectation that the entire disk is in the hot, viscous state during\nsuperoutburst. The resulting constraint on the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter,\nalpha_{hot} ~ 0.1, is consistent with the value inferred from the fast dwarf\nnova decays. By looking at the slow decay rate for superoutbursts, which occur\nin systems below the period gap, in combination with the slow decay rate in one\nlong outburst above the period gap (in U Gem), we infer a steep dependence of\nthe decay rate on orbital period for long outbursts. This implies a steep\ndependence of alpha_{cold} on orbital period, consistent with tidal torquing as\nbeing the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in quiescent disks in\ninteracting binary systems.\n",

The\ninterplay of these mechanisms explains simultaneously the locally enhanced\npairing gap around oxygen defects, and the reduction of average gap as\nincreasing oxygen concentration.\n",

For genuinely flavour-exotic tetraquarks, these constraints\nrequire the existence of two tetraquark states distinguishable by their\npreferred couplings to two ordinary mesons, whereas, for cryptoexotic\ntetraquarks, our constraints may be satisfied by a single tetraquark state,\nwhich then, however, may mix with ordinary mesons.

A famous theorem of Harsanyi shows\nthat, when the principals have a common prior on the outcome distributions of\nall policies, a Pareto-optimal policy for the agent is one that maximizes a\nfixed, weighted linear combination of the principals' utilities.\n  In this paper, we show that Harsanyi's theorem does not hold for principals\nwith different priors, and derive a more precise generalization which does\nhold, which constitutes our main result. In this more general case, the\nrelative weight given to each principal's utility should evolve over time\naccording to how well the agent's observations conform with that principal's\nprior.

It has been widely applied in many fields such as dialogue\nsystems, automatic machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and\nespecially useful in systems with human-computer natural language dialogue\ninterfaces such as virtual assistants and chatbots. The first step of\nidentifying dialog act is identifying the boundary of the dialog act in\nutterances. In this paper, we focus on segmenting the utterance according to\nthe dialog act boundaries, i.e. functional segments identification, for\nVietnamese utterances. We investigate carefully functional segment\nidentification in two approaches: (1) machine learning approach using maximum\nentropy (ME) and conditional random fields (CRFs); (2) deep learning approach\nusing bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a CRF layer\n(Bi-LSTM-CRF) on two different conversational datasets: (1) Facebook messages\n(Message data); (2) transcription from phone conversations (Phone data). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies deep learning based\napproach to dialog act segmentation. As the results show, deep learning\napproach performs appreciably better as to compare with traditional machine\nlearning approaches. Moreover, it is also the first study that tackles dialog\nact and functional segment identification for Vietnamese.\n",

    "abstract": "  In order to reduce domain discrepancy to improve the performance of\ncross-domain spoken language identification (SLID) system, as an unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) method, we have proposed a joint distribution alignment\n(JDA) model based on optimal transport (OT). A discrepancy measurement based on\nOT was adopted for JDA between training and test data sets. In our previous\nstudy, it was supposed that the training and test sets share the same label\nspace. However, in real applications, the label space of the test set is only a\nsubset of that of the training set. Fully matching training and test domains\nfor distribution alignment may introduce negative domain transfer. In this\npaper, we propose an JDA model based on partial optimal transport (POT), i.e.,\nonly partial couplings of OT are allowed during JDA. Moreover, since the label\nof test data is unknown, in the POT, a soft weighting on the coupling based on\ntransport cost is adaptively set during domain alignment. Experiments were\ncarried out on a cross-domain SLID task to evaluate the proposed UDA. Results\nshowed that our proposed UDA significantly improved the performance due to the\nconsideration of the partial couplings in OT.\n",

    "abstract": "  We describe an analytic continuation of the Euclidean Grosse-Wulkenhaar and\nLSZ models which defines a one-parameter family of duality covariant\nnoncommutative field theories interpolating between Euclidean and Minkowski\nspace versions of these models, and provides an alternative regularization to\nthe usual Feynman prescription. This regularization allows for a matrix model\nrepresentation of the field theories in terms of a complex generalization of\nthe usual basis of Landau wavefunctions. The corresponding propagators are\ncalculated and identified with the Feynman propagators of the field theories.\nThe regulated quantum field theories are shown to be UV/IR-duality covariant.\nWe study the asymptotics of the regularized propagators in position and matrix\nspace representations, and confirm that they generically possess a comparably\ngood decay behaviour as in the Euclidean case.\n",

    "abstract": "  As recent multi-modality large language models (MLLMs) have shown formidable\nproficiency on various complex tasks, there has been increasing attention on\ndebating whether these models could eventually mirror human intelligence.\nHowever, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating solely on task\nperformance, such as the accuracy of identifying the attribute of an object.\nCombining well-developed cognitive science to understand the intelligence of\nMLLMs beyond superficial achievements remains largely unexplored. To this end,\nwe introduce the first cognitive-driven multi-lingual and multi-modal benchmark\nto evaluate the general intelligence ability of MLLMs, dubbed M3GIA.\nSpecifically, we identify five key cognitive factors based on the\nwell-recognized Cattell-Horn-Carrol (CHC) model of intelligence and propose a\nnovel evaluation metric. In addition, since most MLLMs are trained to perform\nin different languages, a natural question arises: is language a key factor\ninfluencing the cognitive ability of MLLMs? As such, we go beyond English to\nencompass other languages based on their popularity, including Chinese, French,\nSpanish, Portuguese and Korean, to construct our M3GIA. We make sure all the\ndata relevant to the cultural backgrounds are collected from their native\ncontext to avoid English-centric bias. We collected a significant corpus of\ndata from human participants, revealing that the most advanced MLLM reaches the\nlower boundary of human intelligence in English. Yet, there remains a\npronounced disparity in the other five languages assessed. We also reveals an\ninteresting winner takes all phenomenon that are aligned with the discovery in\ncognitive studies. Our benchmark will be open-sourced, with the aspiration of\nfacilitating the enhancement of cognitive capabilities in MLLMs.\n",

    "abstract": "  Modeling protective relays is crucial for performing accurate stability\nstudies as they play a critical role in defining the dynamic responses of power\nsystems during disturbances. Nevertheless, due to the current limitations of\nstability software and the challenges of keeping track of the changes in the\nsettings information of thousands of protective relays, modeling all the\nprotective relays in bulk power systems is a challenging task. Distance relays\nare among the critical protection schemes, which are not properly modeled in\ncurrent practices of stability studies. This paper proposes a machine\nlearning-based method that uses the results of early-terminated stability\nstudies to identify the critical distance relays required to be modeled in\nthose studies. The algorithm used is the random forest (RF) classifier. GE\npositive sequence load flow analysis (PSLF) software is used to perform\nstability studies. The model is trained and tested on the Western Electricity\nCoordinating Council (WECC) system data representing the 2018 summer peak load\nunder different operating conditions and topologies of the system. The results\nshow the great performance of the method in identifying the critical distance\nrelays. The results also show that only modeling the identified critical\ndistance relays suffices to perform accurate stability studies.\n",

We model the\nvan der Waals forces between the fullerenes by the Lennard-Jones potential. In\nparticular, the pairwise potential energies between the carbon atoms on the\nfullerenes are approximated by the continuous approach, so that the total\nmolecular energy between two fullerenes can be determined analytically. Since\nwe assume that such interactions between the molecules occur at sufficiently\nlarge distance, the classical three body problems analysis is legitimate to\ndetermine the collective angular velocity of the two and three C60 fullerenes\nat the nanoscale. We find that the maximum angular frequency of the two and\nthree fullerenes systems reach the terahertz range and we determine the\nstationary points and the points which have maximum velocity for the carbon\natom for the carbon atom and the two fullerenes system.\n",

    "abstract": "  A strong-coupling series expansion for the Green's function and the\nextremely-correlated Fermi liquid (ECFL) theory are used to calculate the\nmoments of the electronic spectral functions of the infinite-U Hubbard model.\nResults from these two complementary methods agree very well at both, low\ndensities, where the ECFL solution is the most accurate, and at high to\nintermediate temperatures, where the series converge. We find that a modified\nfirst moment, which underestimates the contributions from the occupied states\nand is accessible in the series through the time-dependent Green's function,\nbest describes the quasiparticle peak location in the strongly-correlated\nregime. This is examined by the ECFL results at low temperatures, where it is\nshown that the spectral function is largely skewed towards the occupied states.\n",

    "abstract": "  Background: Accurate segmentation of microscopic structures such as\nbio-artificial capsules in microscopy imaging is a prerequisite to the\ncomputer-aided understanding of important biomechanical phenomenons.\nState-of-the-art segmentation performances are achieved by deep neural networks\nand related data-driven approaches. Training these networks from only a few\nannotated examples is challenging while producing manually annotated images\nthat provide supervision is tedious.\n  Method: Recently, self-supervision, i.e. designing a neural pipeline\nproviding synthetic or indirect supervision, has proved to significantly\nincrease generalization performances of models trained on few shots. The\nobjective of this paper is to introduce one such neural pipeline in the context\nof micro-capsule image segmentation. Our method leverages the rather simple\ncontent of these images so that a trainee network can be mentored by a referee\nnetwork which has been previously trained on synthetically generated pairs of\ncorrupted/correct region masks.\n  Results: Challenging experimental setups are investigated. They involve from\nonly 3 to 10 annotated images along with moderately large amounts of\nunannotated images. In a bio-artificial capsule dataset, our approach\nconsistently and drastically improves accuracy. We also show that the learnt\nreferee network is transferable to another Glioblastoma cell dataset and that\nit can be efficiently coupled with data augmentation strategies.\n  Conclusions: Experimental results show that very significant accuracy\nincrements are obtained by the proposed pipeline, leading to the conclusion\nthat the self-supervision mechanism introduced in this paper has the potential\nto replace human annotations.\n",

In addition, we show that if $k$ is\nuncountable and $R$ is affine noetherian and its prime spectrum is a disjoint\nunion of subspaces that are each homeomorphic to the spectrum of an affine\ncommutative ring then $R$ satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence.

This reset is reproduced by\nannealing the cells with the same thermal budget.

    "abstract": "  We present the Modality Integration Rate (MIR), an effective, robust, and\ngeneralized metric to indicate the multi-modal pre-training quality of Large\nVision Language Models (LVLMs). Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role\nin building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the\ncostly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and\nin-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less\nindicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the\nlack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training\nstage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module\ndesign, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from\nthe inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality\nIntegration Rate, which is 1) \\textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training\nquality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after\nsupervised fine-tuning. 2) \\textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation\ndata. 3) \\textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture\nchoices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the\neffectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative\nabout training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model\narchitecture design to get better pre-training results. We hope MIR could be a\nhelpful metric for building capable LVLMs and inspire the following research\nabout modality alignment in different areas.

    "abstract": "  Anchored covariate-adjusted indirect comparisons inform reimbursement\ndecisions where there are no head-to-head trials between the treatments of\ninterest, there is a common comparator arm shared by the studies, and there are\npatient-level data limitations. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is\nthe most widely used covariate-adjusted indirect comparison method. MAIC has\npoor precision and is inefficient when the effective sample size after\nweighting is small. A modular extension to MAIC, termed two-stage\nmatching-adjusted indirect comparison (2SMAIC), is proposed. This uses two\nparametric models. One estimates the treatment assignment mechanism in the\nstudy with individual patient data (IPD), the other estimates the trial\nassignment mechanism. The resulting weights seek to balance covariates between\ntreatment arms and across studies. A simulation study provides\nproof-of-principle in an indirect comparison performed across two randomized\ntrials and explores the use of weight truncation in combination with MAIC for\nthe first time. Despite enforcing randomization and knowing the true treatment\nassignment mechanism in the IPD trial, 2SMAIC yields improved precision and\nefficiency with respect to MAIC in all scenarios, while maintaining similarly\nlow levels of bias. The two-stage approach is effective when sample sizes in\nthe IPD trial are low, as it controls for chance imbalances in prognostic\nbaseline covariates between study arms. It is not as effective when overlap\nbetween the trials' target populations is poor and the extremity of the weights\nis high. In these scenarios, truncation leads to substantial precision and\nefficiency gains but induces considerable bias. The combination of a two-stage\napproach with truncation produces the highest precision and efficiency\nimprovements.\n",

The proposed algorithm divides the\nobject into discrete image patches according to the pixel distribution of the\nobject by means of clustering. To avoid the drifting of the tracker to false\ntargets, the proposed algorithm extracts the dominant features, such as color\nhistogram or histogram of oriented gradient orientation, from these image\npatches, and uses them as cues for tracking. To enhance the robustness of the\ntracker, the proposed algorithm employs an implicit spatial structure between\nthese patches as another cue for tracking; Afterwards, the proposed algorithm\nincorporates these components into the particle filter framework, which results\nin a robust and precise tracker. Experimental results on color image sequences\nwith different resolutions show that the proposed tracker outperforms the\ncomparison algorithms on handling occlusion in visual tracking.\n",

    "abstract": "  In the framework of the Glauber approach we analyze the shape parameters of\nthe early-formed system and their event-by-event fluctuations. We test a\nvariety of models: the conventional wounded nucleon model, a model admixing\nbinary collisions to the wounded nucleons, a model with hot spots, as well as\nthe hot-spot model where the deposition of energy occurs with a superimposed\nprobability distribution. We look in detail at the so-called participant\nmultipole moments, obtained by an averaging procedure where in each event the\nsystem is translated to its center of mass and aligned with the major principal\naxis of the ellipse of inertia. Quantitative comparisons indicate substantial\nrelative effects for eccentricity in variants of Glauber models. On the other\nhand, the dependence of the scaled standard deviation of the participant\neccentricity on the chosen model is weak. For all models the values range from\nabout 0.5 for the central collisions to about 0.3-0.4 for peripheral\ncollisions, both for the gold-gold and copper-copper collisions. They are\ndominated by statistics and change only by 10-15% from model to model. We\nprovide an approximate analytic expansion for the multipole moments and their\nfluctuations given in terms of the fixed-axes moments. For central collisions\nand in the absence of correlations it gives the simple formula for the scaled\nstandard deviation of the participant eccentricity: sqrt(4/pi-1). Similarly, we\nobtain expansions for the radial profiles of the multipole distributions. We\ninvestigate the relevance of the shape-fluctuation effects for jet quenching\nand find them important only for very central events. Finally, we argue how\nsmooth hydro leads to the known result v_4 ~ v_2^2, and further to the\nprediction Delta v_4/v_4 = 2 Delta v_2/v_2.\n",

One\nchallenge remained untouched is how we can obtain an explanation on why a test\nset fails the KS test. In this paper, we tackle the problem of producing\ncounterfactual explanations for test data failing the KS test. Concept-wise, we\npropose the notion of most comprehensible counterfactual explanations, which\naccommodates both the KS test data and the user domain knowledge in producing\nexplanations. Computation-wise, we develop an efficient algorithm MOCHE (for\nMOst CompreHensible Explanation) that avoids enumerating and checking an\nexponential number of subsets of the test set failing the KS test. MOCHE not\nonly guarantees to produce the most comprehensible counterfactual explanations,\nbut also is orders of magnitudes faster than the baselines. Experiment-wise, we\npresent a systematic empirical study on a series of benchmark real datasets to\nverify the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of most comprehensible\ncounterfactual explanations and MOCHE.\n",

    "abstract": "  We consider a regular singular Sturm-Liouville operator $L:=-\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\n+ \\frac{q(x)}{x^2 (1-x)^2}$ on the line segment $[0,1]$. We impose certain\nboundary conditions such that we obtain a semi-bounded self-adjoint operator.\nIt is known that the $\\zeta$-function of this operator\n$\\zeta_L(s)=\\sum_{\\lambda\\in\\spec(L)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\lambda^{-s}$ has a\nmeromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane with 0 being a regular\npoint. Then, according to Ray and Singer the $\\zeta$-regularized determinant of\n$L$ is defined by $\\detz(L):=\\exp(-\\zeta_L'(0)).$ In this paper we are going to\nexpress this determinant in terms of the solutions of the homogeneous\ndifferential equation $Ly=0$ generalizing earlier work of S. Levit and U.\nSmilansky, T. Dreyfus and H. Dym, and D. Burghelea, L. Friedlander and T.\nKappeler. More precisely we prove the formula $\\detz(L)=\\frac{\\pi W(\\psi,\\phi)}\n{2^{\\nu_0+\\nu_1} \\Gamma(\\nu_0+1)\\Gamma(\\nu_1+1)}.$ Here $\\phi, \\psi$ is a\ncertain fundamental system of solutions for the homogeneous equation $Ly=0$,\n$W(\\phi, \\psi)$ denotes their Wronski determinant, and $\\nu_0, \\nu_1$ are\nnumbers related to the characteristic roots of the regular singular points $0,\n1$.\n",

The first one, ALCreg, is a notational variant of the well-known\nPropositional Dynamic Logic of Fischer and Ladner. The second one, ALCvpl, was\nintroduced and investigated by Loding and Serre in 2007. The logic ALCvpl\ngeneralises many known decidable non-regular extensions of ALCreg.\n  We provide a series of undecidability results. First, we show that\ndecidability of the concept satisfiability problem for ALCvpl is lost upon\nadding the seemingly innocent Self operator. Second, we establish\nundecidability for the concept satisfiability problem for ALCvpl extended with\nnominals. Interestingly, our undecidability proof relies only on one single\nnon-regular (visibly-pushdown) language, namely on r#s# := { r^n s^n | n in N }\nfor fixed role names r and s. Finally, in contrast to the classical database\nsetting, we establish undecidability of query entailment for queries involving\nnon-regular atoms from r#s#, already in the case of ALC-TBoxes.\n",

    "abstract": "  The space of possible behaviors complex biological systems may exhibit is\nunimaginably vast, and these systems often appear to be stochastic, whether due\nto variable noisy environmental inputs or intrinsically generated chaos. The\nbrain is a prominent example of a biological system with complex behaviors. The\nnumber of possible patterns of spikes emitted by a local brain circuit is\ncombinatorially large, though the brain may not make use of all of them.\nUnderstanding which of these possible patterns are actually used by the brain,\nand how those sets of patterns change as properties of neural circuitry change\nis a major goal in neuroscience. Recently, tools from information geometry have\nbeen used to study embeddings of probabilistic models onto a hierarchy of model\nmanifolds that encode how model behaviors change as a function of their\nparameters, giving a quantitative notion of \"distances\" between model\nbehaviors. We apply this method to a network model of excitatory and inhibitory\nneural populations to understand how the competition between membrane and\nsynaptic response timescales shapes the network's information geometry. The\nhyperbolic embedding allows us to identify the statistical parameters to which\nthe model behavior is most sensitive, and demonstrate how the ranking of these\ncoordinates changes with the balance of excitation and inhibition in the\nnetwork.\n",

Layer clouds cover a large proportion of the\nEarth's surface and are important in regulating the planetary radiation budget.\nUsing a new remote sensing method developed at our University Observatory, we\ndemonstrate that charge in the base of stratiform clouds is typically of\nnegative polarity, as expected from theory considering the vertical current\nflow into and out of the cloud. More detailed vertical charge structure of\nlayer clouds can be found using balloon-carried instruments. Our previous\nresearch using in situ balloon observations has demonstrated that, on average,\nthe bulk charge polarity and location agrees with theoretical predictions of\npositive charge at the upper edge and negative charge at the lower edge. Here\nwe present optical and charge measurements of droplets from a variety of\nstratiform clouds, demonstrating the typical variability which is observed.\n",

    "abstract": "  Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations,\nthat often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing\nchiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can\nstabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations\nare metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with\nsame circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite\nsign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism\npotentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open\nquestion, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB)\nmodel approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the\n-- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and\nstill obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and\ndynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that\nan MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the\nHB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more\nimportant role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by\nshifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation\nafter switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled\nvortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical\nvortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient\ndevices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used\nto retain information [1].\n",

    "abstract": "  Categorizing source codes accurately and efficiently is a challenging problem\nin real-world programming education platform management. In recent years,\nmodel-based approaches utilizing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have been widely\napplied to code classification tasks. We introduce an approach named the Sparse\nAttention-based neural network for Code Classification (SACC) in this paper.\nThe approach involves two main steps: In the first step, source code undergoes\nsyntax parsing and preprocessing. The generated abstract syntax tree is split\ninto sequences of subtrees and then encoded using a recursive neural network to\nobtain a high-dimensional representation. This step simultaneously considers\nboth the logical structure and lexical level information contained within the\ncode. In the second step, the encoded sequences of subtrees are fed into a\nTransformer model that incorporates sparse attention mechanisms for the purpose\nof classification. This method efficiently reduces the computational cost of\nthe self-attention mechanisms, thus improving the training speed while\npreserving effectiveness. Our work introduces a carefully designed sparse\nattention pattern that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of\ncode classification tasks. This design helps reduce the influence of redundant\ninformation and enhances the overall performance of the model. Finally, we also\ndeal with problems in previous related research, which include issues like\nincomplete classification labels and a small dataset size. We annotated the\nCodeNet dataset with algorithm-related labeling categories, which contains a\nsignificantly large amount of data. Extensive comparative experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SACC for the code\nclassification tasks.\n",

The search channels target Higgs\nboson production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with\na vector boson. Upper limits are placed on the branching fraction of the Higgs\nboson decay to invisible particles, as a function of the assumed production\ncross sections. The combination of all channels, assuming standard model\nproduction, yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible\nbranching fraction of 0.24 (0.23) at the 95% confidence level. The results are\nalso interpreted in the context of Higgs-portal dark matter models.\n",

Recent constructions based on division algebras convincingly\ndescribe a single generation of leptons and quarks with Standard Model gauge\nsymmetries. Nonetheless, an algebraic origin for the existence of exactly three\ngenerations has proven difficult to substantiate. We motivate $\\mathbb{S}$ as a\nnatural algebraic candidate to describe three generations with $SU(3)_C$ gauge\nsymmetry. We initially represent one generation of leptons and quarks in terms\nof two minimal left ideals of $\\mathbb{C}\\ell(6)$, generated from a subset of\nall left actions of the complex sedenions on themselves. Subsequently we employ\nthe finite group $S_3$, which are automorphisms of $\\mathbb{S}$ but not of\n$\\mathbb{O}$ to generate two additional generations. Given the relative\nobscurity of sedenions, efforts have been made to present the material in a\nself-contained manner.\n",

    "abstract": "  Artificial Intelligence is being employed by humans to collaboratively solve\ncomplicated tasks for search and rescue, manufacturing, etc. Efficient teamwork\ncan be achieved by understanding user preferences and recommending different\nstrategies for solving the particular task to humans. Prior work has focused on\npersonalization of recommendation systems for relatively well-understood tasks\nin the context of e-commerce or social networks. In this paper, we seek to\nunderstand the important factors to consider while designing user-centric\nstrategy recommendation systems for decision-making. We conducted a\nhuman-subjects experiment (n=60) for measuring the preferences of users with\ndifferent personality types towards different strategy recommendation systems.\nWe conducted our experiment across four types of strategy recommendation\nmodalities that have been established in prior work: (1) Single strategy\nrecommendation, (2) Multiple similar recommendations, (3) Multiple diverse\nrecommendations, (4) All possible strategies recommendations. While these\nstrategy recommendation schemes have been explored independently in prior work,\nour study is novel in that we employ all of them simultaneously and in the\ncontext of strategy recommendations, to provide us an in-depth overview of the\nperception of different strategy recommendation systems. We found that certain\npersonality traits, such as conscientiousness, notably impact the preference\ntowards a particular type of system (p < 0.01). Finally, we report an\ninteresting relationship between usability, alignment and perceived\nintelligence wherein greater perceived alignment of recommendations with one's\nown preferences leads to higher perceived intelligence (p < 0.01) and higher\nusability (p < 0.01).\n",

Here,\nwe investigate the question of whether the similar effective two-flavor\napproximation can be formulated for the survival probability in matter. Using a\nperturbative framework with the expansion parameters $\\epsilon$ and $s_{13}\n\\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, we give an affirmative answer to this question and\nthe resultant two-flavor form of the probability is valid to order $\\epsilon$.\nHowever, we observe a contrived feature of the effective $\\Delta m^2_{\\alpha\n\\alpha} (a)$ in matter. It ceases to be a combination of the fundamental\nparameters and has energy dependence, which may be legitimate because it comes\nfrom the matter potential. But, it turned out that $\\Delta m^2_{\\mu \\mu} (a)$\nbecomes $L$-dependent, though $\\Delta m^2_{ee} (a)$ is not, which casts doubt\non adequacy of the concept of effective $\\Delta m^2$ in matter. We also find\nthat the appearance probability in vacuum admits, to order $\\epsilon$, the\nsimilar effective two-flavor form with a slightly different effective $\\Delta\nm^2_{\\beta \\alpha}$ from the disappearance channel. A general result is derived\nto describe suppression of the matter effect in the oscillation probability.\n",

The stability of the\nfixed points of the traveling wave ODEs (in the usual \"spatial\" variable) is\nconsidered. For general functional forms of the nonlinear prey birthrate/prey\ndeathrate or reaction terms, a Hopf bifurcation is shown to occur at two\ndifferent critical values of the traveling wave speed. The post-bifurcation\ndynamics is investigated for five different functional forms of the\nnonlinearities. In cases where the bifurcation is supercritical, the\npost-bifurcation behaviour yields stable periodic orbits of the traveling-wave\nODEs in the spatial variable. These correspond to stable periodic wavetrains of\nthe full PDEs. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations yield more complex\npost-bifurcation dynamics in the PDE wavetrains. In special cases where the\nsubcritical bifurcation marks the end of the regime of stability, the\npost-bifurcation behavior in the spatial ODEs is chaotic, corresponding to\nwavetrains of the original PDEs which are spatially coherent, but have chaotic\ntemporal dynamics. All the models are integrated numerically to investigate the\npost-bifurcation dynamics and chaotic regimes are characterized by computing\npower spectra, autocorrelation functions, and fractal dimensions.\n",

    "abstract": "  Considerable efforts have been invested in augmenting the role-playing\nproficiency of open-source large language models (LLMs) by emulating\nproprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently harbor\nrole-play capabilities, owing to the extensive knowledge of characters and\npotential dialogues ingrained in their vast training corpora. Thus, in this\nstudy, we introduce Ditto, a self-alignment method for role-play. Ditto\ncapitalizes on character knowledge, encouraging an instruction-following LLM to\nsimulate role-play dialogues as a variant of reading comprehension. This method\ncreates a role-play training set comprising 4,000 characters, surpassing the\nscale of currently available datasets by tenfold regarding the number of roles.\nSubsequently, we fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated dataset to augment\nits role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating our meticulously constructed and\nreproducible role-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of MT-Bench, Ditto, in\nvarious parameter scales, consistently maintains a consistent role identity and\nprovides accurate role-specific knowledge in multi-turn role-play\nconversations. Notably, it outperforms all open-source role-play baselines,\nshowcasing performance levels comparable to advanced proprietary chatbots.\nFurthermore, we present the first comprehensive cross-supervision alignment\nexperiment in the role-play domain, revealing that the intrinsic capabilities\nof LLMs confine the knowledge within role-play. Meanwhile, the role-play styles\ncan be easily acquired with the guidance of smaller models. We open-source\nrelated resources at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Ditto.\n",

    "abstract": "  We address the problem of inferring the anatomic skeleton of a person, in an\narbitrary pose, from the 3D surface of the body; i.e. we predict the inside\n(bones) from the outside (skin). This has many applications in medicine and\nbiomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed\nbut do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and\ngraphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned\nfrom data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated\nagainst ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining\nSkeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D\nbody surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male\nand 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit\na parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel\npart-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside\ntraining pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA\nin a pose-normalized space. We then train a regressor from body shape\nparameters to skeleton shape parameters and refine the skeleton to satisfy\nconstraints on physical plausibility. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and\npose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work,\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held-out DXA\nscans, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction\nfrom varied and challenging 3D bodies. The code to infer a skeleton from a body\nshape is available for research at https://osso.is.tue.mpg.de/, and the dataset\nof paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes is available as a\nBiobank Returned Dataset. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank\nResource.\n",

In conventional BC, in order to avoid the\ndifficulty of the carrier estimation, the energy detector is usually considered\nat a receiver at the cost of poor performance. To improve the performance, in\nthis paper, we consider a novel approach that allows the carrier estimation at\nthe receiver via joint estimation and detection. In particular, in the proposed\napproach, the matched-filtering at the BD (for the transmitter filter) is\nemployed to impose a certain property that allows efficient and reliable\ncarrier estimation via joint estimation and detection. Through the performance\nanalysis and simulation results, we show that the matched-filtering at the BD\nin the proposed approach can improve the performance.\n",

We introduce a new class of initial data (which we\ncall {\\itshape generalized step Bernoulli initial data}) for both of these\nmodels that generalizes the step Bernoulli initial data studied in a number of\nrecent works on the ASEP. Under this class of initial data, we analyze the\ncurrent fluctuations of both the ASEP and stochastic six-vertex model and\nestablish the existence of a phase transition along a characteristic line,\nacross which the fluctuation exponent changes from $1 / 2$ to $1 / 3$. On the\ncharacteristic line, the current fluctuations converge to the general (rank\n$k$) Baik-Ben-Arous-P\\'{e}ch\\'{e} distribution for the law of the largest\neigenvalue of a critically spiked covariance matrix. For $k = 1$, this was\nestablished for the ASEP by Tracy and Widom; for $k > 1$ (and also $k = 1$, for\nthe stochastic six-vertex model), the appearance of these distributions in both\nmodels is new.\n",

We utilize this\ninnovative model, based on strategic parameter rescaling, to study a recently\nproposed collisional flavor instability caused by the asymmetry of emission and\nabsorption rates between $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ for four different static\nbackgrounds taken from different stages in a core-collapse supernova\nsimulation. Our results confirm that collisional instabilities generally exist\naround the neutrinosphere during the SN accretion and post-accretion phase, as\nsuggested by [arXiv:2104.11369]. However, the growth and transport of flavor\ninstabilities can only be fully captured by models with global simulations as\ndone in this work. With minimal ingredient to trigger collisional\ninstabilities, we find that the flavor oscillations and transport mainly affect\n(anti)neutrinos of heavy lepton flavors around their decoupling sphere, which\nthen leave imprints on their energy spectra in the free-streaming regime. For\nelectron (anti)neutrinos, their properties remain nearly intact. We also\nexplore various effects due to the decoherence from neutrino-nucleon\nscattering, artificially enhanced decoherence from emission and absorption,\nneutrino vacuum mixing, and inhomogeneous matter profile, and discuss the\nimplication of our work.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper we explore the use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to\nformalize, and reason about, psychological knowledge. In the field of\npsychology, a considerable amount of knowledge is still expressed using only\nnatural language. This lack of a formalization complicates accurate studies,\ncomparisons, and verification of theories. We believe that ASP, a knowledge\nrepresentation formalism allowing for concise and simple representation of\ndefaults, uncertainty, and evolving domains, can be used successfully for the\nformalization of psychological knowledge. To demonstrate the viability of ASP\nfor this task, in this paper we develop an ASP-based formalization of the\nmechanics of Short-Term Memory. We also show that our approach can have rather\nimmediate practical uses by demonstrating an application of our formalization\nto the task of predicting a user's interaction with a graphical interface.\n",

    "abstract": "  A recent article \"An X-ray chimney extending hundreds of parsecs above and\nbelow the Galactic Centre\" (2019, Nature, 567, 34) reported the detection of\nchimney-like X-ray-emitting features above and below the Galactic Center from\nXMM-Newton observations. We note here that these features were already reported\nby our Suzaku papers: Nakashima et al. (2013, ApJ, 773, 20, arXiv:1310.4236)\nfor the southern feature and Nakashima et al. (2019, ApJ, in press,\narXiv:1903.02571) for the northern feature. In particular, Nakashima et al.\n(2013) show that the ionization state of the southern feature is not in\ncollisional ionization equilibrium and is most likely in a recombining or\nover-ionized state, which suggests its origin in the Galactic Center about 0.1\nMyr ago.\n",

With suitable choices of model parameters, we show that\nthe background cosmology in this model can mimic that of a LCDM Universe to\nhigh precision. However, as the cosmic expansion goes through the\ndecelerating-accelerating transition, the density perturbations in this fluid\nare rapidly damped out. We show that,although this does not significantly\naffect structure formation in baryonic matter, it makes the gravitational\npotential decay rapidly at late times, leading to modifications in predictions\nof cosmological observables such as the CMB power spectrum and weak lensing.\nThis model of unified dark matter is thus difficult to reconcile with\nastronomical observations. We also clarify the differences with respect to\nother unified dark matter models where the fluid is barotropic, i.e., p=p(rho),\nsuch as the (generalized) Chaplygin gas model, and point out their\nobservational difficulties. We also summarize the status of dark sector models\nwith no new dynamical degrees of freedom introduced and discuss the problems\nwith them.\n",

    "abstract": "  Cubic spline interpolation on Euclidean space is a standard topic in\nnumerical analysis, with countless applications in science and technology. In\nseveral emerging fields, for example computer vision and quantum control, there\nis a growing need for spline interpolation on curved, non-Euclidean space. The\ngeneralization of cubic splines to manifolds is not self-evident, with several\ndistinct approaches. One possibility is to mimic the acceleration minimizing\nproperty, which leads to Riemannian cubics. This, however, require the solution\nof a coupled set of non-linear boundary value problems that cannot be\nintegrated explicitly, even if formulae for geodesics are available. Another\npossibility is to mimic De~Casteljau's algorithm, which leads to generalized\nB\\'ezier curves. To construct C2-splines from such curves is a complicated\nnon-linear problem, until now lacking numerical methods. Here we provide an\niterative algorithm for C2-splines on Riemannian symmetric spaces, and we prove\nconvergence of linear order. In terms of numerical tractability and\ncomputational efficiency, the new method surpasses those based on Riemannian\ncubics. Each iteration is parallel, thus suitable for multi-core\nimplementation. We demonstrate the algorithm for three geometries of interest:\nthe $n$-sphere, complex projective space, and the real Grassmannian.\n",

The present\narticle introduces the concept of hybrid intervals, in which points may have\nnegative multiplicity. Various operations on hybrid intervals have compact and\nelegant formulations that do not require cases to handle different orders of\nthe end points.

    "abstract": "  In this paper, the main objective is to generalize to the\nNavier-Stokes-Korteweg (with density dependent viscosities satisfying the BD\nrelation) and Euler-Korteweg systems a recent relative entropy [proposed by D.\nBresch, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] introduced for the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with a linear density dependent shear viscosity and a\nzero bulk viscosity. As a concrete application, this helps to justify\nmathematically the convergence between global weak solutions of the quantum\nNavier-Stokes system [recently obtained simultaneously by I. Lacroix-Violet and\nA. Vasseur (2017)] and dissipative solutions of the quantum Euler system when\nthe viscosity coefficient tends to zero: This selects a dissipative solution as\nthe limit of a viscous system. We also get weak-strong uniqueness for the\nQuantum-Euler and for the Quantum-Navier-Stokes equations. Our results are\nbased on the fact that Euler-Korteweg systems and corresponding\nNavier--Stokes-Korteweg systems can be reformulated through an augmented system\nsuch as the compressible Navier-Stokes system with density dependent\nviscosities satisfying the BD algebraic relation. This was also observed\nrecently [by D. Bresch, F. Couderc, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] for the\nEuler-Korteweg system for numerical purposes. As a by-product of our analysis,\nwe show that this augmented formulation helps to define relative entropy\nestimates for the Euler Korteweg systems in a simplest way compared to recent\nworks [See D. Donatelli, E. Feireisl, P. Marcati (2015) and J. Giesselmann, C.\nLattanzio, A.-E. Tzavaras (2017)] with less hypothesis required on the\ncapillary coefficient.\n",

The main\nalgorithm proposed in this paper approximates the optimal strategy for any\nworkload of linear counting queries. With no cost to the privacy guarantee, the\nmechanism improves significantly on prior approaches and achieves near-optimal\nerror for many workloads, when applied under (\\epsilon, \\delta)-differential\nprivacy. The result is an adaptive mechanism which can help users achieve good\nutility without requiring that they reason carefully about the best formulation\nof their task.\n",

However, in applications where the cost function to be optimized\nis non-smooth, modern trajectory optimization methods have extremely slow\nconvergence. In this work, we present TRON, an iterative solver that can be\nused for efficient trajectory optimization in applications with non-smooth cost\nfunctions that are composed of smooth components. TRON achieves this by\nexploiting the structure of the objective to adaptively smooth the cost\nfunction, resulting in a sequence of objectives that can be efficiently\noptimized. TRON is provably guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the\nnon-smooth convex cost function when the dynamics are linear, and to a\nstationary point when the dynamics are nonlinear. Empirically, we show that\nTRON has faster convergence and lower final costs when compared to other\ntrajectory optimization methods on a range of simulated tasks including\ncollision-free motion planning for a mobile robot, sparse optimal control for\nsurgical needle, and a satellite rendezvous problem.\n",

    "abstract": "  The first generations of quantum computers will execute fault-tolerant\nquantum circuits, and it is very likely that such circuits will use surface\nquantum error correcting codes. To the best of our knowledge, no complete\ndesign automation tool for such circuits is currently available. This is to a\nlarge extent because such circuits have three dimensional layouts (e.g. two\ndimensional hardware and time axis as a third dimension) and their optimisation\nis still ongoing research. This work introduces SurfBraid, a tool for the\nautomatic design of surface code protected quantum circuits -- it includes a\ncomplete workflow that compiles an arbitrary quantum circuit into an\nintermediary Clifford+T equivalent representation which is further synthesised\nand optimised to surface code protected structures (for the moment, braided\ndefects). SurfBraid is arguably the first flexible (modular structure,\nextensible through user provided scripts) and interactive (automatically\nupdating the results based on user interaction, browser based) tool for such\ncircuits. One of the prototype's methodological novelty is its capability to\nautomatically estimate the resources necessary for executing large\nfault-tolerant circuits. A prototype implementation and the corresponding\nsource code are available at https://alexandrupaler.github.io/quantjs/.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this work, a quasi-linear model for plasma flow response to the resonant\nmagnetic perturbation (RMP) in a tokamak has been rigorously developed in the\nresistive-inertial (RI) and viscous-resistive (VR) regimes purely from the\ntwo-field reduced MHD model. Models for plasma response to RMP are commonly\ncomposed of equations for the resonant magnetic field response (i.e. the\nmagnetic island) and the torque balance of plasma flow. However, in previous\nplasma response models, the magnetic island and the torque balance equations\nare often derived separately from reduced MHD and full MHD equations,\nrespectively. By contrast, in this work we derive both the magnetic island\nresponse and the torque balance equations in a quasi-linear model for plasma\nflow response entirely from a set of two-field reduced MHD equations. Such a\nquasi-linear model can recover previous plasma flow response models within\ncertain limits and approximations. Furthermore, the physical origins of\nquasi-linear forces and moments in the flow response equation are also\naccurately calculated and clarified self-consistently.\n",

    "abstract": "  We start with reviewing the origin of the idea that entropy and the Second\nLaw are associated with the Arrow of Time. We then introduced a new definition\nof entropy based on Shannons Measure of Information, SMI. The SMI may be\ndefined on any probability distribution, and therefore it is a very general\nconcept. On the other hand entropy is defined on a very special set of\nprobability distributions. More specifically the entropy of a thermodynamic\nsystem is related the probability distribution of locations and velocities or\nmomenta of all the particles, which maximized the Shannon Measure of\nInformation. As such, entropy is not a function of time. We also show that the\nH function, as defined by Boltzmann is an SMI but not entropy. Therefore, while\nthe H-function, as an SMI may change with time, Entropy, as a limit of the SMI\ndoes not change with time.\n",

    "abstract": "  While the modern science is characterized by an exponential growth in\nscientific literature, the increase in publication volume clearly does not\nreflect the expansion of the cognitive boundaries of science. Nevertheless,\nmost of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding\nand policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level\nof knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy\ngreater visibility, does not necessarily mean that \"big science\" leads to\ncognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the\nextents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature\nindependently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles\npublished over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method\nis based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research\narticles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent\nstochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the\nperiods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in\npublication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger\nteams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of)\narticles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role\nof small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries\nof science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive\nterritory can also be applied to study many other aspects of \"science of\nscience.\"\n",

    "abstract": "  Ultrarefractory (UR) phases in CAIs could have formed at higher T compared to\ncommon CAI minerals and thus they potentially provide constraints on very\nhigh-T processes in the solar nebula. We report a detailed characterization of\nan UR phase davisite bearing CAI from a reduced type CV chondrite. Absence of\nsecondary iron- and/or alkali-rich phases and occurrence of LIME olivine\nindicate that primitive chemical and isotopic compositions are preserved in the\nCAI. Davisite occur only in one lithological unit that consists of three\nchemically and isotopically distinct parts: i) $^{16}$O-poor regions with\nreversely-zoned melilite and davisite; ii) $^{16}$O-rich regions consisting of\nunzoned, gehlenitic melilite, diopside and spinel; and iii) spinel framboids\ncomposed of $^{16}$O-rich spinel and $^{16}$O-poor melilite. Random\ndistribution of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities with sharp boundaries in\nthe CAI indicates its formation by an aggregation of mineral assemblages formed\nand processed separately at different time and/or space. Although isotope\nexchange prior to the final agglomeration of the CAI cannot be ruled out, we\nsuggest that modification of chemical and isotopic composition of porous CAI\nprecursors or aggregation of isotopically distinct mineral assemblages are\nalternative scenarios for the origin of O-isotopic heterogeneity in CAIs. In\neither case, coexistence of spatially and/or temporally distinct $^{16}$O-rich\nand -poor gaseous reservoirs at the earliest stage of the solar system\nformation is required. The grain-scale oxygen isotopic disequilibrium in the\nCAI indicate that post-formation heating of the CAI was short, which can be\nachieved by rapid outward transport of the CAI. High\nTi$^{3+}$/Ti$^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ ratios of pyroxene and presence of LIME olivine\ndocument that the entire CAI formation process took place under highly reducing\nconditions.\n",

    "abstract": "  We report results of a spectroscopic campaign carried out at the 10 m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias for a sample of 22 BL Lac objects detected (or candidates)\nat TeV energies, aimed to determine or constrain their redshift. This is of\nfundamental importance for the interpretation of their emission models, for\npopulation studies and also mandatory to study the interaction of high energy\nphotons with the extragalactic background light using TeV sources. High\nsignal-to-noise optical spectra in the range 4250 - 10000 {\\AA} were obtained\nto search for faint emission and/or absorption lines from both the host galaxy\nor the nucleus. We determine a new redshift for PKS 1424+240 (z = 0.604) and a\ntentative one for 1ES 0033+595 (z = 0.467). We are able to set new\nspectroscopic redshift lower limits for other three sources on the basis of Mg\nII and Ca II intervening absorption features: BZB J1243+3627 (z > 0.483), BZB\nJ1540+8155 (z > 0.672), and BZB 0J2323+4210 (z > 0.267). We confirm previous\nredshift estimates for four blazars: S3 0218+357 (z = 0.944), 1ES 1215+303 (z =\n0.129), W Comae (z = 0.102), and MS 1221.8+2452 (z = 0.218). For the remaining\ntargets, in seven cases (S2 0109+22, 3C 66A, VER J0521+211, S4 0954+65, BZB\nJ1120+4214, S3 1227+25, BZB J2323+4210), we do not validate the proposed\nredshift. Finally for all sources of still unknown redshift, we set a lower\nlimit based on the minimum equivalent width of absorption features expected\nfrom the host galaxy.\n",

    "abstract": "  In this paper, the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constraints is\nconsidered with delayed channel state information at transmitters (CSIT). We\npropose a novel secure retrospective interference alignment scheme in which the\ntransmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial noises to ensure\nconfidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is\nchallenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of\nthe transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: phase one in which each\ntransmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats\nsuch transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter\nuses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net\ninterference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is\nsimultaneously useful for all receivers. These phases are designed to ensure\nthe decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy\nconstraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: 1)\n$K$-user interference channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and we show\nthat $\\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{K} -6) $ SDoF is achievable, 2) $K$-user interference\nchannel with an external eavesdropper (IC-EE), and 3) $K$-user IC with\nconfidential messages and an external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for\nthe $K$-user IC-EE, $\\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{K} -3) $ SDoF is achievable, and for\nthe $K$-user IC-CM-EE, $\\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{K} -6) $ is achievable. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first result on the $K$-user interference channel\nwith secrecy constrained models and delayed CSIT that achieves a SDoF which\nscales with $K$, the number of users.\n",

    "abstract": "  The lack of haptic feedback in Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery\n(RMIS) is a potential barrier to safe tissue handling during surgery. Bayesian\nmodeling theory suggests that surgeons with experience in open or laparoscopic\nsurgery can develop priors of tissue stiffness that translate to better force\nestimation abilities during RMIS compared to surgeons with no experience. To\ntest if prior haptic experience leads to improved force estimation ability in\nteleoperation, 33 participants were assigned to one of three training\nconditions: manual manipulation, teleoperation with force feedback, or\nteleoperation without force feedback, and learned to tension a silicone sample\nto a set of force values. They were then asked to perform the tension task, and\na previously unencountered palpation task, to a different set of force values\nunder teleoperation without force feedback. Compared to the teleoperation\ngroups, the manual group had higher force error in the tension task outside the\nrange of forces they had trained on, but showed better speed-accuracy functions\nin the palpation task at low force levels. This suggests that the dynamics of\nthe training modality affect force estimation ability during teleoperation,\nwith the prior haptic experience accessible if formed under the same dynamics\nas the task.\n",

    "abstract": "  The semiclassical Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with multiscale and random\npotentials often appears when studying electron dynamics in heterogeneous\nquantum systems. As time evolves, the wavefunction develops high-frequency\noscillations in both the physical space and the random space, which poses\nsevere challenges for numerical methods. In this paper, we propose a multiscale\nreduced basis method, where we construct multiscale reduced basis functions\nusing an optimization method and the proper orthogonal decomposition method in\nthe physical space and employ the quasi-Monte Carlo method in the random space.\nOur method is verified to be efficient: the spatial gridsize is only\nproportional to the semiclassical parameter and the number of samples in the\nrandom space is inversely proportional to the same parameter. Several\ntheoretical aspects of the proposed method, including how to determine the\nnumber of samples in the construction of multiscale reduced basis and\nconvergence analysis, are studied with numerical justification. In addition, we\ninvestigate the Anderson localization phenomena for Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith correlated random potentials in both 1D and 2D.\n",

    "abstract": "  We extract the $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section in the energy\nrange between 600 and 900 MeV, exploiting the method of initial state\nradiation. A data set with an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ taken at\na center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII\ncollider is used. The cross section is measured with a systematic uncertainty\nof 0.9%. We extract the pion form factor $|F_\\pi|^2$ as well as the\ncontribution of the measured cross section to the leading order hadronic vacuum\npolarization contribution to $(g-2)_\\mu$. We find this value to be\n$a_\\mu^{\\pi\\pi,\\rm LO}(600-900\\;\\rm MeV) = (368.2 \\pm 2.5_{\\rm stat} \\pm\n3.3_{\\rm sys})\\cdot 10^{-10}$.\n",

    "abstract": "  Pixel detectors for precise particle tracking in high energy physics have\nbeen developed to a level of maturity during the past decade. Three of the LHC\ndetectors will use vertex detectors close to the interaction point based on the\nhybrid pixel technology which can be considered the state of the art in this\nfield of instrumentation. A development period of almost 10 years has resulted\nin pixel detector modules which can stand the extreme rate and timing\nrequirements as well as the very harsh radiation environment at the LHC without\nsevere compromises in performance. From these developments a number of\ndifferent applications have spun off, most notably for biomedical imaging.\nBeyond hybrid pixels, a number of monolithic or semi-monolithic developments,\nwhich do not require complicated hybridization but come as single sensor/IC\nentities, have appeared and are currently developed to greater maturity. Most\nadvanced in terms of maturity are so called CMOS active pixels and DEPFET\npixels. The present state in the construction of the hybrid pixel detectors for\nthe LHC experiments together with some hybrid pixel detector spin-off is\nreviewed. In addition, new developments in monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel\ndevices are summarized.\n",

These networks are characterized by several quantities such as the\nunderlying graph connectivity (topology), how they grow in time, scaling laws\nor by the mean time a random search can cover a network and also by shortest\npath between two nodes. We present here a novel type of network property based\non a unidirectional transport mechanism occurring in the Endoplasmic Reticulum\nnetwork found in the cell cytoplasm. This mechanism is an active-waiting\ntransportation, where molecules have to wait a random time before being\ntransported from one node to the next one. We find that the consequence of this\nunusual network transportation is that molecules travel together by recurrent\npackets, which quite a large deviation behavior compared to classical\npropagation in graphs. To conclude, this form of transportation is associated\nwith an efficient and robust molecular redistribution inside cells.\n",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the time evolution of the redshift of the spectrum of\nelectromagnetic radiation that is emitted by the star that moves in the\nvicinity of supermassive black hole. For the case of Schwarzschild black hole\nwe solve this problem exactly in General Theory of Relativity. Also we\nformulate an approach that gives possibilities to solve the inverse problem:\nreconstruction of motion of a star in the vicinity of black hole using the\nredshift data. This approach consists of two steps. The first step gives\npossibilities to find unique solution for the integrals of motion of the star\nby solution of a system of non-linear equations, rather than the direct\napplication of standard statistical methods. For this purpose we consider\nproperties of congruences of isotropic geodesics that connect of the worldline\nof the source and the worldline of the observer. The second step is the\napplication of standard least squares method in order to obtain more accurate\nsolution. This approach is used on the numerical model of the star in the\nvicinity of the Center of our Galaxy.\n",

    "abstract": "  We address the problem of estimating a sparse low-rank matrix from its noisy\nobservation. We propose an objective function consisting of a data-fidelity\nterm and two parameterized non-convex penalty functions. Further, we show how\nto set the parameters of the non-convex penalty functions, in order to ensure\nthat the objective function is strictly convex. The proposed objective function\nbetter estimates sparse low-rank matrices than a convex method which utilizes\nthe sum of the nuclear norm and the $\\ell_1$ norm. We derive an algorithm (as\nan instance of ADMM) to solve the proposed problem, and guarantee its\nconvergence provided the scalar augmented Lagrangian parameter is set\nappropriately. We demonstrate the proposed method for denoising an audio signal\nand an adjacency matrix representing protein interactions in the `Escherichia\ncoli' bacteria.\n",

    "abstract": "  We discuss the relations between restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) states\nand the matrix product states (MPS) for the ground states of 1D translational\ninvariant stabilizer codes. A generic translational invariant and finitely\nconnected RBM state can be expressed as an MPS, and the matrices of the\nresulting MPS are of rank 1. We dub such an MPS as an RBM-MPS. This provides a\nnecessary condition for exactly realizing a quantum state as an RBM state, if\nthe quantum state can be written as an MPS. For generic 1D stabilizer codes\nhaving a non-degenerate ground state with periodic boundary condition, we\nobtain an expression for the lower bound of their MPS bond dimension, and an\nupper bound for the rank of their MPS matrices. In terms of RBM, we provide an\nalgorithm to derive the RBM for the cocycle Hamiltonians whose MPS matrices are\nproved to be of rank 1. Moreover, the RBM-MPS produced by our algorithm has the\nminimal bond dimension. A family of examples is provided to explain the\nalgorithm. We finally conjecture that these features hold true for all the 1D\nstabilizer codes having a non-degenerate ground state with periodic boundary\ncondition, as long as their MPS matrices are of rank 1.\n",

In this second part we extend the description\nto the hydrogen atom testing the correctness and accuracy of the general\ndescription. The relation between electron and proton in the atom is described\nsystematically in a construction that is free from analogies or ad-hoc\nderivations and it supersedes conventional Quantum Mechanics (whose equations\nlinked to measurements can be recovered). We briefly discuss why the concept of\nisolation built in Schr\\\"odinger's time evolution is not acceptable and how it\nimmediately results in the well known measurement paradoxes of quantum\nmechanics. We also discuss the epistemic grounds of the development as well as\nthose of conventional Quantum Mechanics.\n",

However, the GA links are susceptible to frequent blockages at\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. During a link blockage, the channel\ninformation cannot be obtained reliably. In this work, we provide a novel\nmethod of channel prediction during the GA link blockage at 28 GHz. In our\napproach, the multipath components (MPCs) along a UAV flight trajectory are\narranged into independent path bins based on the minimum Euclidean distance\namong the channel parameters of the MPCs. After the arrangement, the channel\nparameters of the MPCs in individual path bins are forecasted during the\nblockage. An autoregressive model is used for forecasting. The results obtained\nfrom ray tracing simulations indicate a close match between the actual and the\npredicted mmWave channel.\n",

We consider three\nclasses of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where\nnon-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level\nsystems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with\nrespect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures\ndepending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is\nsensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action\nof the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account\nthe dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling\nregime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n",

    "abstract": "  Palm oil production has been identified as one of the major drivers of\ndeforestation for tropical countries. To meet supply chain objectives,\ncommodity producers and other stakeholders need timely information of land\ncover dynamics in their supply shed. However, such data are difficult to obtain\nfrom suppliers who may lack digital geographic representations of their supply\nsheds and production locations. Here we present a \"community model,\" a machine\nlearning model trained on pooled data sourced from many different stakeholders,\nto produce a map of palm probability at global scale. An advantage of this\nmethod is the inclusion of varied inputs, the ability to easily update the\nmodel as new training data becomes available and run the model on any year that\ninput imagery is available. Inclusion of diverse data sources into one\nprobability map can help establish a shared understanding across stakeholders\non the presence and absence of a land cover or commodity (in this case oil\npalm). The model predictors are annual composites built from publicly available\nsatellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS-2, and terrain\ndata from Jaxa (AW3D30) and Copernicus (GLO-30). We provide map outputs as the\nprobability of palm in a given pixel, to reflect the uncertainty of the\nunderlying state (palm or not palm). This version of this model provides global\naccuracy estimated to be 92% (at 0.5 probability threshold) on an independent\ntest set. This model, and resulting oil palm probability map products are\nuseful for accurately identifying the geographic footprint of palm cultivation.\nUsed in conjunction with timely deforestation information, this palm model is\nuseful for understanding the risk of continued oil palm plantation expansion in\nsensitive forest areas.\n",

Based on this model we prove that\nproper mesh reconstruction is able to control the oscillations; we provide\nbounds for the Total Variation (TV) of the numerical solution. We moreover\nprove under more strict assumptions that the increase of the TV -due to the\noscillatory behaviour of the numerical schemes- decreases with time; hence\nproving that the overall scheme is TV Increase-Decreasing (TVI-D).\n",

Due to the limitation of\nthe computational budget, existing methods usually implement conditional\ndiffusion models with an autoregressive inference pipeline, in which the future\nfragment is predicted based on the distribution of adjacent past frames.\nHowever, only the conditions from a few previous frames can't capture the\nglobal temporal coherence, leading to inconsistent or even outrageous results\nin long-term video prediction. In this paper, we propose a Local-Global Context\nguided Video Diffusion model (LGC-VD) to capture multi-perception conditions\nfor producing high-quality videos in both conditional/unconditional settings.\nIn LGC-VD, the UNet is implemented with stacked residual blocks with\nself-attention units, avoiding the undesirable computational cost in 3D Conv.\nWe construct a local-global context guidance strategy to capture the\nmulti-perceptual embedding of the past fragment to boost the consistency of\nfuture prediction. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training strategy to\nalleviate the effect of noisy frames for more stable predictions. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance\non video prediction, interpolation, and unconditional video generation.

    "abstract": "  We introduce Ev-TTA, a simple, effective test-time adaptation algorithm for\nevent-based object recognition. While event cameras are proposed to provide\nmeasurements of scenes with fast motions or drastic illumination changes, many\nexisting event-based recognition algorithms suffer from performance\ndeterioration under extreme conditions due to significant domain shifts. Ev-TTA\nmitigates the severe domain gaps by fine-tuning the pre-trained classifiers\nduring the test phase using loss functions inspired by the spatio-temporal\ncharacteristics of events. Since the event data is a temporal stream of\nmeasurements, our loss function enforces similar predictions for adjacent\nevents to quickly adapt to the changed environment online. Also, we utilize the\nspatial correlations between two polarities of events to handle noise under\nextreme illumination, where different polarities of events exhibit distinctive\nnoise distributions. Ev-TTA demonstrates a large amount of performance gain on\na wide range of event-based object recognition tasks without extensive\nadditional training. Our formulation can be successfully applied regardless of\ninput representations and further extended into regression tasks. We expect\nEv-TTA to provide the key technique to deploy event-based vision algorithms in\nchallenging real-world applications where significant domain shift is\ninevitable.\n",

With the rapid development\nof deep neural network technology, depth estimation has been extensively\nstudied and shown potential for practical applications. However, in\nparticularly challenging environments such as low-light and noisy underwater\nconditions, direct application of machine learning models may not yield the\ndesired results. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach to enhance\nunderwater image quality to improve depth estimation effectiveness. First,\nunderwater images are processed through methods such as color compensation,\nbrightness equalization, and enhancement of contrast and sharpness of objects\nin the image. Next, we perform depth estimation using the Udepth model on the\nenhanced images. Finally, the results are evaluated and presented to verify the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the enhanced depth image quality approach for\nunderwater robots.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present simultaneous ASCA and RXTE observations of Ark 564, the brightest\nknown ``narrow-line'' Seyfert 1 in the 2-10 keV band. The measured X-ray\nspectrum is dominated by a steep (Gamma~2.7) power-law continuum extending to\nat least 20 keV, with imprinted Fe K-line and -edge features and an additional\n``soft excess'' below ~1.5 keV. The energy of the iron K-edge indicates the\npresence of highly ionised material, which we identify in terms of reflection\nfrom a strongly irradiated accretion disc. The high reflectivity of this\nputative disc, together with its strong intrinsic O VIII Ly-alpha and O VIII\nrecombination emission, can also explain much of the observed soft excess flux.\nFurthermore, the same spectral model also provides a reasonable match to the\nvery steep 0.1-2 keV spectrum deduced from ROSAT data. The source is much more\nrapidly variable than ``normal'' Seyfert 1s of comparable luminosity,\nincreasing by a factor of ~50% in 1.6 hours, with no measurable lag between the\n0.5-2 keV and 3-12 keV bands, consistent with much of the soft excess flux\narising from reprocessing of the primary power-law component in the inner\nregion of the accretion disc. We note, finally, that if the unusually steep\npower-law component is a result of Compton cooling of a disc corona by an\nintense soft photon flux, then the implication is that the bulk of these soft\nphotons lie in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet.\n",

    "abstract": "  Open-shell benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons (BPHs) are promising materials\nfor future quantum applications. However, the search and realization of\nopen-shell BPHs with desired properties is a challenging task due to the\ngigantic chemical space of BPHs, requiring new strategies for both theoretical\nunderstanding and experimental advancement. In this work, by building a\nstructure database of BPHs through graphical enumeration, performing\ndata-driven analysis, and combining tight-binding and mean-field Hubbard\ncalculations, we discovered that the number of the internal vertices of the BPH\ngraphs is closely correlated to their open-shell characters. We further\nestablished a series of simple rules, the triangle counting rule (TCR), to\npredict the magnetic ground state of BPHs. These findings not only provide a\ndatabase of open-shell BPHs, but also extend the well-known Lieb's theorem and\nOvchinnikov's rule and provide a straightforward method for designing\nopen-shell carbon nanostructures. These insights may aid in the exploration of\nemerging quantum phases and the development of magnetic carbon materials for\ntechnology applications.\n",

    "abstract": "  A multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation is the main computation unit for DSP\napplications. DSP blocks are one of the efficient solutions to implement MACs\nin FPGA's. However, since the DSP blocks have wide multiplier and adder blocks,\nMAC operations using low bit-length parameters lead to an underutilization\nproblem. Hence, an efficient approximation technique is introduced. The\ntechnique includes manipulation and approximation of the low bit-length\nfixed-point parameters based upon a Single DSP - Multiple Multiplication (SDMM)\nexecution. The SDMM changes the traditional MAC implementation in the DSP block\nby separating multiplication and accumulation operations. While the accumulator\nhardware available in the DSP block is used for multiple parameter\nmultiplication, parallel LUTs are employed for the accumulation part of the MAC\noperation. The accuracy of the developed optimization technique was evaluated\nfor different CNN weight bit precisions using the Alexnet and VGG-16 networks\nand the Tiny ImageNet dataset. The optimization can be implemented without loss\nof accuracy in almost all cases, while it causes slight accuracy losses in a\nfew cases. Through these optimizations, the SDMM is performed at the cost of a\nsmall hardware overhead. For example, a single DSP block executes 3 8-bit\nfixed-point parameter multiplications. As a result of our optimizations, the\nparameters are represented in a different format on off-chip memory, providing\nup to 33% compression without any hardware cost. The compression rate can be\nfurther increased by up to 97% when used in conjunction with other compression\nmethods for the VGG-16. Reaching this compression rate requires extra hardware\ncost. A prototype systolic array architecture was implemented employing our\noptimizations on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. It reduced the number of DSP blocks by\n66.6%, 75%, and 83.3% for 8, 6, and 4-bit input variables, respectively.\n",

Indeed,\nthe choice of the metric is crucial, and it is highly dependent on the dataset\ncharacteristics. However a single metric could be used to correctly perform\nclustering on multiple datasets of different domains. We propose to do so,\nproviding a framework for learning a transferable metric. We show that we can\nlearn a metric on a labelled dataset, then apply it to cluster a different\ndataset, using an embedding space that characterises a desired clustering in\nthe generic sense. We learn and test such metrics on several datasets of\nvariable complexity (synthetic, MNIST, SVHN, omniglot) and achieve results\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art while using only a small number of\nlabelled training datasets and shallow networks.\n",

In contrast, associative importance exposes information leakage\nbut does not provide causal insight into the model's mechanism. We introduce\nDEDACT - a framework to decompose well-established direct and associative\nimportance measures into their respective associative and direct components.\nDEDACT provides insight into both the sources of prediction-relevant\ninformation in the data and the direct and indirect feature pathways by which\nthe information enters the model.

We\npresent a theoretical framework for discovering statistically significant\nlexical co-occurrences from a given corpus. In contrast with the prevalent\npractice of giving weightage to unigram frequencies, we focus only on the\ndocuments containing both the terms (of a candidate bigram). We detect biases\nin span distributions of associated words, while being agnostic to variations\nin global unigram frequencies. Our framework has the fidelity to distinguish\ndifferent classes of lexical co-occurrences, based on strengths of the document\nand corpuslevel cues of co-occurrence in the data. We perform extensive\nexperiments on benchmark data sets to study the performance of various\nco-occurrence measures that are currently known in literature. We find that a\nrelatively obscure measure called Ochiai, and a newly introduced measure CSA\ncapture the notion of lexical co-occurrence best, followed next by LLR, Dice,\nand TTest, while another popular measure, PMI, suprisingly, performs poorly in\nthe context of lexical co-occurrence.\n",

A further challenge in modeling morphogenesis is the parameterization\nof such models. Here we discuss COMSOL-based methods for parameter\noptimization. These routines can be used to determine parameter sets, for which\nthe simulations reproduce experimental data and constraints. Such data is often\nimage based, but may also come from classical biochemical or genetic\nexperiments.\n",

    "abstract": "  In order to study the effect of interaction and lattice distortion on quantum\ncoherence in one-dimensional Fermi systems, we calculate the ground state\nenergy and the phase sensitivity of a ring of interacting spinless fermions on\na dimerized lattice. Our numerical DMRG (Density Matrix Renormalization Group)\nstudies, in which we keep up to 1000 states for systems of about 100 sites, are\nsupplemented by analytical considerations using bosonization techniques. We\nfind a delocalized phase for an attractive interaction, which differs from that\nobtained for random lattice distortions. The extension of this delocalized\nphase depends strongly on the dimerization induced modification of the\ninteraction. Taking into account the harmonic lattice energy, we find a\ndimerized ground state for a repulsive interaction only. The dimerization is\nsuppressed at half filling, when the correlation gap becomes large.\n",

We\nanalyze the development history of 160 million software projects for a total of\n2.2 billion commits contributed by 43 million distinct authors over a period of\n50 years. We classify author names by gender using name frequencies and author\ngeographical locations using heuristics based on email addresses and time\nzones. We study the evolution over time of contributions to public code by\ngender and by world region. For the world overall, we confirm previous findings\nabout the low but steadily increasing ratio of contributions by female authors.\nWhen breaking down by world regions we find that the long-term growth of female\nparticipation is a worldwide phenomenon. We also observe a decrease in the\nratio of female participation during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that\nwomen's ability to contribute to public code has been more hindered than that\nof men.\n",

The flare is a long duration event with soft\nX-ray and EUV radiation lasting for over four hours. Analysis suggests that\nmagnetic reconnection and formation of new loops continue for more than two\nhours. Furthermore, the UV 1600\\AA\\ observations show that each of the\nindividual pixels at the feet of flare loops is brightened instantaneously with\na timescale of a few minutes, and decays over a much longer timescale of more\nthan 30 minutes. We use these spatially resolved UV light curves during the\nrise phase to construct empirical heating functions for individual flare loops,\nand model heating of coronal plasmas in these loops. The total coronal\nradiation of these flare loops are compared with soft X-ray and EUV radiation\nfluxes measured by GOES and AIA. This study presents a method to\nobservationally infer heating functions in numerous flare loops that are formed\nand heated sequentially by reconnection throughout the flare, and provides a\nvery useful constraint to coronal heating models.\n",

    "abstract": "  We propose an explanation of the variability of AGN based on a cloud model of\naccretion onto a black hole. These clouds, present at a distance of 10-100\nSchwarzschild radii, possibly come from the disrupted innermost disk and they\ncan partially obscure the central X-ray source due to their extreme Compton\noptical depth. We consider the implications of this scenario using a toy model\nof AGN spectra and support the results with full radiative transfer\ncomputations from the codes TITAN and NOAR. We show that small random\nrearrangements of the cloud distribution can happen on timescales of the order\nof 10^2 - 10^6 s and may lead to relatively high variability amplitude in the\nX-ray band if the mean covering factor is large. The normalized variability\namplitude in the UV band is either the same as in the X-ray band, if the\ncontribution from the dark sides of the clouds to the UV band is negligible, or\nit is smaller. The X-ray spectrum should basically preserve its spectral shape\neven during the high amplitude variability, within the frame of our model.\n",

The power communications model is\nincorporated in the life time model of wireless sensor networks. The life time\nmodel takes into consideration several parameters such as the total number of\nsensors, network size, percentage of sink nodes, location of sensors, the\nmobility of sensors, power consumption when nodes move and the power\nconsumption of communications. The new model for power consumption in\ncommunications shows more accurate results about the lifetime of the sensor\nnetwork in comparison with previously published results.\n",

    "abstract": "  YES! We introduce a variable power Maxwell nonlinear electrodynamics theory\nwhich can remove the singularity of electric field of point-like charges at\ntheir locations. One of the main problems of Maxwell's electromagnetic field\ntheory is related to the existence of singularity for electric field of\npoint-like charges at their locations. In other words, the electric field of a\npoint-like charge diverges at the charge location which leads to an infinite\nself-energy. In order to remove this singularity a few nonlinear\nelectrodynamics (NED) theories have been introduced. Born-Infeld (BI) NED\ntheory is one of the most famous of them. However the power Maxwell (PM) NED\ncannot remove this singularity. In this paper, we show that the PM NED theory\ncan remove this singularity, when the power of PM NED is less than\n$s<\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",

While many algorithms for the problem of\nchange point detection have been developed over time, it can be challenging to\nselect the appropriate algorithm for a specific problem. The choice of the\nalgorithm heavily depends on the nature of the problem and the underlying data\nsource. In this paper, we will exclusively examine unsupervised techniques due\nto their flexibility in the application to various data sources without the\nrequirement for abundant annotated training data and the re-calibration of the\nmodel.

We show through asymptotic analysis that\nlong-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive\nnonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions\nof the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions\nconsisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for\nmoderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger\ninitial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these\nbehaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further\ncomputational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time\nnon-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized\nin previous works.\n",

One critical factor\nhindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where\nLLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In\nthis paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large\nlanguage models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models\nin various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of\nvarious recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to\nautomatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 87% hallucinations for\nLlama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy\nof 81%, all without relying on external knowledge.\n",

    "abstract": "  As communications are increasingly taking place virtually, the ability to\npresent well online is becoming an indispensable skill. Online speakers are\nfacing unique challenges in engaging with remote audiences. However, there has\nbeen a lack of evidence-based analytical systems for people to comprehensively\nevaluate online speeches and further discover possibilities for improvement.\nThis paper introduces SpeechMirror, a visual analytics system facilitating\nreflection on a speech based on insights from a collection of online speeches.\nThe system estimates the impact of different speech techniques on effectiveness\nand applies them to a speech to give users awareness of the performance of\nspeech techniques. A similarity recommendation approach based on speech factors\nor script content supports guided exploration to expand knowledge of\npresentation evidence and accelerate the discovery of speech delivery\npossibilities. SpeechMirror provides intuitive visualizations and interactions\nfor users to understand speech factors. Among them, SpeechTwin, a novel\nmultimodal visual summary of speech, supports rapid understanding of critical\nspeech factors and comparison of different speech samples, and SpeechPlayer\naugments the speech video by integrating visualization of the speaker's body\nlanguage with interaction, for focused analysis. The system utilizes\nvisualizations suited to the distinct nature of different speech factors for\nuser comprehension. The proposed system and visualization techniques were\nevaluated with domain experts and amateurs, demonstrating usability for users\nwith low visualization literacy and its efficacy in assisting users to develop\ninsights for potential improvement.\n",

    "abstract": "  We introduce and analyze a novel approach to the problem of speaker\nidentification in multi-party recorded meetings. Given a speech segment and a\nset of available candidate profiles, we propose a novel data-driven way to\nmodel the distance relations between them, aiming at identifying the speaker\nlabel corresponding to that segment. To achieve this we employ a recurrent,\nmemory-based architecture, since this class of neural networks has been shown\nto yield advanced performance in problems requiring relational reasoning. The\nproposed encoding of distance relations is shown to outperform traditional\ndistance metrics, such as the cosine distance. Additional improvements are\nreported when the temporal continuity of the audio signals and the speaker\nchanges is modeled in. In this paper, we have evaluated our method in two\ndifferent tasks, i.e. scripted and real-world business meeting scenarios, where\nwe report a relative reduction in speaker error rate of 39.28% and 51.84%,\nrespectively, compared to the baseline.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper presents methods which are aimed at finding approximations to\nmissing data in a dataset by using optimization algorithms to optimize the\nnetwork parameters after which prediction and classification tasks can be\nperformed. The optimization methods that are considered are genetic algorithm\n(GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), random\nforest (RF) and negative selection (NS) and these methods are individually used\nin combination with auto-associative neural networks (AANN) for missing data\nestimation and the results obtained are compared. The methods suggested use the\noptimization algorithms to minimize an error function derived from training the\nauto-associative neural network during which the interrelationships between the\ninputs and the outputs are obtained and stored in the weights connecting the\ndifferent layers of the network. The error function is expressed as the square\nof the difference between the actual observations and predicted values from an\nauto-associative neural network. In the event of missing data, all the values\nof the actual observations are not known hence, the error function is\ndecomposed to depend on the known and unknown variable values. Multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) neural network is employed to train the neural networks using\nthe scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) method. Prediction accuracy is determined\nby mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute\nerror (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) computations. Accuracy in\nclassification is obtained by plotting ROC curves and calculating the areas\nunder these. Analysis of results depicts that the approach using RF with AANN\nproduces the most accurate predictions and classifications while on the other\nend of the scale is the approach which entails using NS with AANN.\n",

    "abstract": "  A novel random walk based model for inter-core cross-talk (IC-XT)\ncharacterization of multi-core fibres capable of accurately representing both\ntime-domain distribution and frequency-domain representation of experimental\nIC-XT has been proposed. It was demonstrated that this model is a\ngeneralization of the most widely used model in literature to which it will\nconverge when the number of samples and measurement time-window tend to\ninfinity. In addition, this model is consistent with statistical analysis such\nas short term average crosstalk (STAXT), keeping the same convergence\nproperties and it showed to be almost independent to time-window. To validate\nthis model, a new type of characterization of the IC-XT in the dB domain (based\non a pseudo random walk) has been proposed and the statistical properties of\nits step distribution have been evaluated. The performed analysis showed that\nthis characterization is capable of fitting every type of signal source with an\naccuracy above 99.3%. It also proved to be very robust to time-window length,\ntemperature and other signal properties such as symbol rate and pseudo-random\nbit stream (PRBS) length. The obtained results suggest that the model was able\nto communicate most of the relevant information using a short observation time,\nmaking it suitable for IC-XT characterization and core-pair source signal\nclassification. Using machine-learning (ML) techniques for source-signal\nclassification, we empirically demonstrated that this technique carries more\ninformation regarding IC-XT than traditional statistical methods.\n",

We report the discovery of the recycled pulsar PSR\n1751-2737 with a spin period of 2.23 ms. PSR 1751-2737 appears to be an\nisolated recycled pulsar located within the disk of our Galaxy, and it is not\npart of the putative bulge population of pulsars that are thought to be\nresponsible for the excess GeV emission. However, our initial success in this\nsmall pilot survey suggests that this hybrid method (i.e. wide-field\ninterferometric imaging followed up with single dish pulsation searches) may be\nan efficient alternative strategy for testing whether a putative bulge\npopulation of pulsars is responsible for the GeV excess.\n",

    "abstract": "  Video generation technologies are developing rapidly and have broad potential\napplications. Among these technologies, camera control is crucial for\ngenerating professional-quality videos that accurately meet user expectations.\nHowever, existing camera control methods still suffer from several limitations,\nincluding control precision and the neglect of the control for subject motion\ndynamics. In this work, we propose I2VControl-Camera, a novel camera control\nmethod that significantly enhances controllability while providing\nadjustability over the strength of subject motion. To improve control\nprecision, we employ point trajectory in the camera coordinate system instead\nof only extrinsic matrix information as our control signal. To accurately\ncontrol and adjust the strength of subject motion, we explicitly model the\nhigher-order components of the video trajectory expansion, not merely the\nlinear terms, and design an operator that effectively represents the motion\nstrength. We use an adapter architecture that is independent of the base model\nstructure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes show that our framework\noutperformances previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "  As the era of autonomous cyber-physical systems (ACPSs), such as unmanned\naerial vehicles and self-driving cars, unfolds, the demand for robust testing\nmethodologies is key to realizing the adoption of such systems in real-world\nscenarios. However, traditional software testing paradigms face unprecedented\nchallenges in ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems. In\nresponse, this paper pioneers a strategic roadmap for simulation-based testing\nof ACPSs, specifically focusing on autonomous systems. Our paper discusses the\nrelevant challenges and obstacles of ACPSs, focusing on test automation and\nquality assurance, hence advocating for tailored solutions to address the\nunique demands of autonomous systems. While providing concrete definitions of\ntest cases within simulation environments, we also accentuate the need to\ncreate new benchmark assets and the development of automated tools tailored\nexplicitly for autonomous systems in the software engineering community. This\npaper not only highlights the relevant, pressing issues the software\nengineering community should focus on (in terms of practices, expected\nautomation, and paradigms), but it also outlines ways to tackle them. By\noutlining the various domains and challenges of simulation-based\ntesting/development for ACPSs, we provide directions for future research\nefforts.\n",

    "abstract": "  We study the LHC signal of a light gluino whose cascade decay is dominated by\nchannels involving top, and, sometimes, bottom quarks. This is a generic\nsignature for a number of supersymmetry breaking scenarios considered recently,\nwhere the squarks are heavier than gauginos. Third generation final states\ngenerically dominate since third generation squarks are typically somewhat\nlighter in these models. At the LHC we demonstrate that early discovery is\npossible due to the existence of multi-lepton multi-bottom final states which\nhave fairly low Standard Model background. We find that the best discovery\nchannel is 'same sign dilepton'. The relative decay branching ratios into tt,\ntb and bb states carry important information about the underlying model.\nAlthough reconstruction will yield evidence for the existence of top quarks in\nthe event, we demonstrate that identifying multiple top quarks suffers from low\nefficiency and large combinatorial background, due to the large number of final\nstate particles. We propose a fitting method which takes advantage of excesses\nin a large number of channels. We demonstrate such a method will allow us to\nextract information about decay branching ratios with moderate integrated\nluminosities. In addition, the method also gives an upper bound on the gluino\nproduction cross section and an estimate of the gluino mass.\n",

    "abstract": "  Scalability for handling unknown slot values is a important problem in\ndialogue state tracking (DST). As far as we know, previous scalable DST\napproaches generally rely on either the candidate generation from slot tagging\noutput or the span extraction in dialogue context. However, the candidate\ngeneration based DST often suffers from error propagation due to its pipelined\ntwo-stage process; meanwhile span extraction based DST has the risk of\ngenerating invalid spans in the lack of semantic constraints between start and\nend position pointers. To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose\na novel scalable dialogue state tracking method based on slot tagging\nnavigation, which implements an end-to-end single-step pointer to locate and\nextract slot value quickly and accurately by the joint learning of slot tagging\nand slot value position prediction in the dialogue context, especially for\nunknown slot values. Extensive experiments over several benchmark datasets show\nthat the proposed model performs better than state-of-the-art baselines\ngreatly.\n",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the production of primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) arising\nfrom First Order Phase Transitions (FOPTs) associated to neutrino mass\ngeneration in the context of type-I and inverse seesaw schemes. We examine both\n\"high-scale\" as well as \"low-scale\" variants, with either explicit or\nspontaneously broken lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ in the neutrino sector. In\nthe latter case, a pseudo-Goldstone majoron-like boson may provide a candidate\nfor cosmological dark matter. We find that schemes with softly-broken $U(1)_L$\nand with single Higgs-doublet scalar sector lead to either no FOPTs or too weak\nFOPTs, precluding the detectability of GWs in present or near future\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, we found that, in the majoron-like seesaw scheme\nwith spontaneously broken $U(1)_L$ at finite temperatures, one can have strong\nFOPTs and non-trivial primordial GW spectra which can fall well within the\nfrequency and amplitude sensitivity of upcoming experiments, including LISA,\nBBO and u-DECIGO. However, GWs observability clashes with invisible Higgs decay\nconstraints from the LHC. A simple and consistent fix is to assume the\nmajoron-like mass to lie above the Higgs-decay kinematical threshold. We also\nfound that the majoron-like variant of the low-scale seesaw mechanism implies a\ndifferent GW spectrum than the one expected in the high-scale seesaw. This\nfeature will be testable in future experiments. Our analysis shows that GWs can\nprovide a new and complementary portal to test the neutrino mass generation\nmechanism.\n",

Upon\nlowering the temperature, the phonon-electron heat transfer rate decreases and,\nas a result, a heat current bottleneck develops between the phonons, which can\nin some cases be primarily responsible for heating the sample, and the\nelectrons. The contribution that the electrons make to the total low-$T$ heat\ncurrent is thus limited by the phonon-electron heat transfer rate, and falls\nrapidly with decreasing temperature, resulting in the apparent low-$T$ downturn\nof the thermal conductivity. We obtain the temperature and magnetic field\ndependence of the low-$T$ thermal conductivity in the presence of\nphonon-electron thermal decoupling and find good agreement with the data in\nboth the normal and superconducting states.\n",

    "abstract": "  In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function\nneural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the\nefficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties\nof numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods,\nintegrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful\nspatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to\nsignificant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly\nin cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for\ntraining unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic\nrepresentation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random\nparticles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally\ninherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against\nspatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the\ntrajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process\nand calculate the expectation via the probability density function of\nneighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance\naccuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo\nsampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and\nNavier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and\nefficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines.

    "abstract": "  Projection-free optimization via different variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW)\nmethod has become one of the cornerstones in large scale optimization for\nmachine learning and computational statistics. Numerous applications within\nthese fields involve the minimization of functions with self-concordance like\nproperties. Such generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions do not necessarily\nfeature a Lipschitz continuous gradient, nor are they strongly convex. Indeed,\nin a number of applications, e.g. inverse covariance estimation or\ndistance-weighted discrimination problems in support vector machines, the loss\nis given by a GSC function having unbounded curvature, implying absence of\ntheoretical guarantees for the existing FW methods. This paper closes this\napparent gap in the literature by developing provably convergent FW algorithms\nwith standard O(1/k) convergence rate guarantees. If the problem formulation\nallows the efficient construction of a local linear minimization oracle, we\ndevelop a FW method with linear convergence rate.\n",

The intrinsic scale is analogous\nto the \"charge\" of quasisolitons that controls the strength of interaction\nbetween multiple clusters, leading to non-trivial cluster statistics from\nrandom perturbations to initial uniform traffic. The cluster statistics depend\nboth on the charge and the density of the traffic lane; the relationship is\nqualitatively universal for general car-following models.\n",

The targets were identified bright CO GMCs\nselected from the IRAM 30m CO survey with various morphologies and\nenvironments. The clouds vary in galactocentric distances from 2.4 to 15.5kpc.\nThe HCN and HCO+ emission is easily detected in almost all observed positions,\nwith line widths generally similar to the CO ones and there is a good\ncorrelation between the two dense gas tracers. The HCO+ emission is slightly\nstronger than the HCN, in particular towards GMCs with a strong star formation\nactivity. However the HCO+ emission is weaker than the HCN towards a quiescent\ncloud in the inner part of M31, which could be due to a lower abundance of\nHCO+. We derive I_HCN/I_CO ratios between 0.008 and 0.03 and I_HCO+/I_CO ratios\nbetween less than 0.003 and 0.04. We study the radial distribution of the dense\ngas in the disk of M31. Unlike our Galaxy the HCO+/CO ratio is lower in the\ncenter of M31 than in the arms, which can be explained by both a lower\nabundance of HCO+ and different conditions of excitation. Furthermore the\nHCN/CO and HCO+/CO ratios appear to be higher in the inner spiral arm and\nweaker in the outer arm.\n",

    "abstract": "  Piecewise constant denoising can be solved either by deterministic\noptimization approaches, based on the Potts model, or by stochastic Bayesian\nprocedures. The former lead to low computational time but require the selection\nof a regularization parameter, whose value significantly impacts the achieved\nsolution, and whose automated selection remains an involved and challenging\nproblem. Conversely, fully Bayesian formalisms encapsulate the regularization\nparameter selection into hierarchical models, at the price of high\ncomputational costs. This contribution proposes an operational strategy that\ncombines hierarchical Bayesian and Potts model formulations, with the double\naim of automatically tuning the regularization parameter and of maintaining\ncomputational effciency. The proposed procedure relies on formally connecting a\nBayesian framework to a l2-Potts functional. Behaviors and performance for the\nproposed piecewise constant denoising and regularization parameter tuning\ntechniques are studied qualitatively and assessed quantitatively, and shown to\ncompare favorably against those of a fully Bayesian hierarchical procedure,\nboth in accuracy and in computational load.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for energy management\nin aircraft with hybrid electric propulsion systems consisting of gas turbine\nand electric motor components. Series and parallel configurations are\nconsidered. By combining a point-mass aircraft dynamical model with models of\nelectrical losses and losses in the gas turbine, the fuel consumed over a given\nfuture flight path is minimised subject to constraints on the battery, electric\nmotor and gas turbine. The optimization is formulated as a convex problem under\nmild assumptions and its solution is used to define a predictive energy\nmanagement control law that takes into account the variation in aircraft mass\nduring flight. We investigate the performance of algorithms for solving this\nproblem. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is\nproposed and compared with a general purpose convex interior point solver. We\nalso show that the ADMM implementation reduces the required computation time by\norders of magnitude in comparison with a general purpose nonlinear programming\nsolver, making it suitable for real-time supervisory energy management control.\n",

    "abstract": "  Using first-principles calculations, we analyze the structural properties of\ntungsten trioxide WO3 . Our calculations rely on density functional theory and\nthe use of the B1-WC hybrid functional, which provides very good agreement with\nexperimental data. The hypothetical high-symmetry cubic reference structure\ncombines several ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive (antipolar cation\nmotions, rotations and tilts of oxygen octahedra) structural instabilities. The\ninstability related to antipolar W motions combines with those associated to\noxygen rotations and tilts to produce the biggest energy reduction, yielding a\nP21/c ground state. This non-polar P21/c phase is only different from the\nexperimentally reported Pc ground state by the absence of a very tiny\nadditional ferroelectric distortion. The calculations performed on a\nstoichiometric compound so suggest that the low temperature phase of WO3 is not\nintrinsically ferroelectric and that the reported ferroelectric character might\narise from extrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies. Independently, we also\nidentify never observed R3m and R3c ferroelectric phases with large\npolarizations and low energies close to the P 21/c ground state, which makes\nWO3 a potential antiferroelectric material. The relative stability of various\nphases is discussed in terms of the couplings between different structural\ndistortions, highlighting a very complex interplay involving improper-like\ncouplings up to fourth order in the energy expansion in the cubic phase.\n",

    "abstract": "  It has been proposed that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies exhibits\na secondary dependence on star formation rate (SFR), and that the resulting\nM-Z-SFR relation may be redshift-invariant, i.e., \"fundamental.\" However,\nconflicting results on the character of the SFR dependence, and whether it\nexists, have been reported. To gain insight into the origins of the conflicting\nresults, we (a) devise a non-parametric, astrophysically motivated analysis\nframework based on the offset from the star-forming (\"main\") sequence at a\ngiven stellar mass (relative specific SFR), (b) apply this methodology and\nperform a comprehensive re-analysis of the local M-Z-SFR relation, based on\nSDSS, GALEX, and WISE data, and (c) study the impact of sample selection, and\nof using different metallicity and SFR indicators. We show that metallicity is\nanti-correlated with specific SFR regardless of the indicators used. We do not\nfind that the relation is spurious due to correlations arising from biased\nmetallicity measurements, or fiber aperture effects. We emphasize that the\ndependence is weak/absent for massive galaxies ($\\log M_*>10.5$), and that the\noverall scatter in the M-Z-SFR relation does not greatly decrease from the M-Z\nrelation. We find that the dependence is stronger for the highest SSFR galaxies\nabove the star-forming sequence. This two-mode behavior can be described with a\nbroken linear fit in 12+log(O/H) vs. log (SFR$/M_*$), at a given $M_*$.\nPrevious parameterizations used for comparative analysis with higher redshift\nsamples that do not account for the more detailed behavior of the local M-Z-SFR\nrelation may incorrectly lead to the conclusion that those samples follow a\ndifferent relationship.\n",

However, NL2VIS faces challenges in interpreting ambiguous queries,\nas users often express their visualization needs in imprecise language. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce nvBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate NL2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0\nincludes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding\nvisualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a\ncontrolled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries\nthrough a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed\nvisualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields\nmultiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query\ntraceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths.\nWe evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform\nambiguous NL2VIS tasks using nvBench 2.0. We also propose Step-NL2VIS, an\nLLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous\nscenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that\nStep-NL2VIS outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for\nambiguous NL2VIS tasks.\n",

    "abstract": "  A new experimental technique for investigating characteristics of plasma\ngenerated with plasmotrons in electrophysical installations was proposed. The\ntechnique involves a simultaneous registration of both radiation spectra and\nimages of plasma and consequent analysis of the registered data [1]. The\nexperimental technique proposed permits to acquire much more information about\nplasma characteristics compared to common techniques of separate registration\nof spectra and images and reveal possible correlation between spectral\nparameters and image features of plasma [2]. The technique proposed was\nexperimentally realized using complex of apparatus fulfilling simultaneous\nregistration of both radiation spectra and images of plasma generated in\nelectrophysical installations designed for destruction of hazardous and harmful\nsubstances [3]. Analysis of the data acquired using the proposed technique\npermits to find both optimum operating conditions of existing plasmochemical\nreactors and the optimum number and spatial arrangement of plasmotrons in\nreactors being designed. Optimization here means attaining maximum\neffectiveness of destruction of the substances, increasing destruction speed,\nreducing consumption of electric power and consumable chemicals, and a whole\nnumber of the other positive results. It is also possible to use output signals\nof the registering apparatus to control plasmotrons'operating conditions in\nreal time i.e. to build plasmochemical reactor with feedback.\n",

    "abstract": "  Reversible, diffusionless, first-order solid-solid phase transitions\naccompanied by caloric effects are critical for applications in the solid-state\ncooling and heat-pumping devices. Accelerated discovery of caloric materials\nrequires reliable but faster estimators for predictions and high-throughput\nscreening of system-specific dominant caloric contributions. We assess\nreliability of the computational methods that provide thermodynamic properties\nin relevant solid phases at or near a phase transition. We test the methods\nusing the well-studied B2 FeRh alloy as a \"fruit fly\" in such a materials\ngenome discovery, as it exhibits a metamagnetic transition which generates\nmulticaloric (magneto-, elasto-, and baro-caloric) responses. For lattice\nentropy contributions, we find that the commonly-used linear-response and\nsmall-displacement phonon methods are invalid near instabilities that arise\nfrom the anharmonicity of atomic potentials, and we offer a more reliable and\nprecise method for calculating lattice entropy at a fixed temperature. Then, we\napply a set of reliable methods and estimators to the metamagnetic transition\nin FeRh (predicted $346 \\pm 12$ K, observed $353 \\pm 1$ K) and calculate the\nassociated caloric properties, such as isothermal entropy and isentropic\ntemperature changes.\n",

    "abstract": "  In tokamaks, the stability of magneto-hydrodynamic modes can be modified by\npopulations of energetic particles. In ITER-type fusion reactors, such\npopulations can be generated by fusion reactions or auxiliary heating. The\nelectron-driven fishbone mode results from the resonant interaction of the\ninternal kink mode with the slow toroidal precessional motion of energetic\nelectrons and is frequently observed in present-day tokamaks with Electron\nCyclotron Resonance Heating or Lower Hybrid Current Drive. In Tore Supra,\nelectron-driven fishbones are observed during LHCD-powered discharges in which\na high-energy tail of the electronic distribution function is created. Although\nthe destabilization of those modes is related to the existence of a fast\nparticle population, the modes are observed at a frequency that is lower than\nexpected. The linear stability analysis of electron-driven fishbone modes is\nthe main focus of this thesis. The fishbone dispersion relation is derived in a\nform that accounts for the contribution of the parallel motion of passing\nparticles to the resonance condition. The MIKE code is developed to compute and\nsolve the dispersion relation of electron-driven fishbones. The code is\nsuccessfully benchmarked against theory using simple analytical distributions.\nUsing the code MIKE with parametric distributions and equilibria, we show that\nboth barely trapped and barely passing electrons resonate with the mode and can\ndrive it unstable. More deeply trapped and passing electrons have a\nnon-resonant effect on the mode that is, respectively, stabilizing and\ndestabilizing. MIKE simulations using complete ECRH-like distribution functions\nshow that energetic barely passing electrons can contribute to drive a mode\nunstable at a relatively low frequency. This observation could provide some\ninsight to the understanding of Tore Supra experiments.\n",

We investigate the quark deconfinement phase\ntransition in cold (T = 0) and hot beta-stable hadronic matter. Assuming a\nfirst order phase transition, we calculate and compare the nucleation rate and\nthe nucleation time due to quantum and thermal nucleation mechanisms. We show\nthat above a threshold value of the central pressure a pure hadronic star (HS)\n(i.e. a compact star with no fraction of deconfined quark matter) is metastable\nto the conversion to a quark star (QS) (i.e. a hybrid star or a strange star).\nThis process liberates an enormous amount of energy, of the order of\n10^{53}~erg, which causes a powerful neutrino burst, likely accompanied by\nintense gravitational waves emission, and possibly by a second delayed (with\nrespect to the supernova explosion forming the HS) explosion which could be the\nenergy source of a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB). This stellar conversion\nprocess populates the QS branch of compact stars, thus one has in the Universe\ntwo coexisting families of compact stars: pure hadronic stars and quark stars.\nWe introduce the concept of critical mass M_{cr} for cold HSs and\nproto-hadronic stars (PHSs), and the concept of limiting conversion temperature\nfor PHSs. We show that PHSs with a mass M < M_{cr} could survive the early\nstages of their evolution without decaying to QSs. Finally, we discuss the\npossible evolutionary paths of proto-hadronic stars.\n",

    "abstract": "  Competition among news sources may encourage some sources to share fake news\nand misinformation to influence the public. While sharing misinformation may\nlead to a short-term gain in audience engagement, it may damage the reputation\nof these sources, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale\nbehind sharing misinformation, we model the competition as a zero-sum\nsequential game, where each news source influences individuals based on its\ncredibility-how trustworthy the public perceives it-and the individual's\nopinion and susceptibility. In this game, news sources can decide whether to\nshare factual information to enhance their credibility or disseminate\nmisinformation for greater immediate attention at the cost of losing\ncredibility. We employ the quantal response equilibrium concept, which accounts\nfor the bounded rationality of human decision-making, allowing for imperfect or\nprobabilistic choices. Our analysis shows that the resulting equilibria for\nthis game reproduce the credibility-bias distribution observed in real-world\nnews sources, with hyper-partisan sources more likely to spread misinformation\nthan centrist ones. It further illustrates that disseminating misinformation\ncan polarize the public. Notably, our model reveals that when one player\nincreases misinformation dissemination, the other player is likely to follow,\nexacerbating the spread of misinformation. We conclude by discussing potential\nstrategies to mitigate the spread of fake news and promote a more factual and\nreliable information landscape.\n",

    "abstract": "  Existing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models mainly handle translation in\nthe general domain, while overlooking domains with special writing formulas,\nsuch as e-commerce and legal documents. Taking e-commerce as an example, the\ntexts usually include amounts of domain-related words and have more grammar\nproblems, which leads to inferior performances of current NMT methods. To\naddress these problems, we collect two domain-related resources, including a\nset of term pairs (aligned Chinese-English bilingual terms) and a parallel\ncorpus annotated for the e-commerce domain. Furthermore, we propose a two-step\nfine-tuning paradigm (named G2ST) with self-contrastive semantic enhancement to\ntransfer one general NMT model to the specialized NMT model for e-commerce. The\nparadigm can be used for the NMT models based on Large language models (LLMs).\nExtensive evaluations on real e-commerce titles demonstrate the superior\ntranslation quality and robustness of our G2ST approach, as compared with\nstate-of-the-art NMT models such as LLaMA, Qwen, GPT-3.5, and even GPT-4.\n",

    "abstract": "  Applying the modified Barrow entropy, inspired by the quantum fluctuation\neffects, to the cosmological background, and using thermodynamics-gravity\nconjuncture, the Friedmann equations get modified as well. In this paper, we\nexplore the holographic dark energy with Granda-Oliveros (GO) IR cutoff, in the\ncontext of the modified Barrow cosmology. First, we assume two dark components\nof the universe evolves independently and obtain the cosmological parameters\nand explore the cosmic evolution. Second, we consider an interaction term\nbetween dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). We observe that the Barrow\nparameter $\\delta$ crucially affects the cosmic dynamics, causes the transition\nfrom the decelerating phase to the accelerating phase occurs later. We find out\nthat the equation of state parameter is in the quintessence region in the past\nand crosses the phantom divide at the present time. Finally, we examine the\nsquared speed of sound analysis for this model. According to the squared sound\nspeed diagrams, the results indicate that the presence of interaction between\nDM and DE as well as increasing in the value of $\\delta$ leads to the\nmanifestation of signs of instability in the past $(v_s^2<0)$. Furthermore, by\nexamining the statefinder, we find that presence of $\\delta$ also makes a\ndistinction between holographic dark energy in Barrow cosmology with GO-IR\ncutoff and the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In fact, increasing $\\delta$ causes the\nstatefinder diagram move away from the point of $\\left\\lbrace r,s\\right\\rbrace=\n\\left\\lbrace 1,0\\right\\rbrace$ at $z=0$.\n",

The positive values of $\\delta$ found in UGC\n5282 (and the other star forming galaxies) is likely due to infalling low\nmetallicity gas from the intergalactic medium that mixes with the galaxy's ISM\non kpc scales. This model is also consistent with broad Ly$\\alpha$ emission\ndetected at the bottom of the DLA absorption, offset by $\\sim 125$ km s$^{-1}$\nfrom the absorption velocity.

    "abstract": "  We propose a coarse-graining procedure for describing the superhorizon\ndynamics of inflationary tensor modes. Our aim is to formulate a stochastic\ndescription for the statistics of spin-2 modes which seed the background of\ngravitational waves from inflation. Using basic principles of quantum\nmechanics, we determine a probability density for coarse-grained tensor fields,\nwhich satisfies a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation at superhorizon scales. The\ncorresponding noise and drift are computable, and depend on the cosmological\nsystem under consideration. Our general formulas are applied to a variety of\ncosmological scenarios, also considering cases seldom considered in the context\nof stochastic inflation, and which are important for their observational\nconsequences. We start obtaining the expected expressions for noise and drift\nin pure de Sitter and power-law inflation, also including a discussion of\neffects of non-attractor phases. We then apply our methods to describe\nscenarios with a transition from inflation to standard cosmological eras of\nradiation and matter domination. We show how the interference between modes\nflowing through the cosmological horizon, and modes spontaneously produced at\nsuperhorizon scales, can affect the stochastic evolution of coarse-grained\ntensor quantities. In appropriate limits, we find that the corresponding\nspectrum of tensor modes at horizon crossing matches with the results of\nquantum field theory calculations, but we also highlight where differences can\narise.\n",

In contrast, neurons in artificial\nneural networks abstract away this complexity, typically down to a scalar\nactivation function of a weighted sum of inputs. Here we emulate more\nbiologically realistic neurons by learning canonical activation functions with\ntwo input arguments, analogous to basal and apical dendrites. We use a\nnetwork-in-network architecture where each neuron is modeled as a multilayer\nperceptron with two inputs and a single output. This inner perceptron is shared\nby all units in the outer network. Remarkably, the resultant nonlinearities\noften produce soft XOR functions, consistent with recent experimental\nobservations about interactions between inputs in human cortical neurons. When\nhyperparameters are optimized, networks with these nonlinearities learn faster\nand perform better than conventional ReLU nonlinearities with matched parameter\ncounts, and they are more robust to natural and adversarial perturbations.\n",

    "abstract": "  The theoretical description of observables at collider experiments relies on\nfactorization theorems separating perturbative dynamics from universal\nnon-perturbative matrix elements. Despite significant recent progress in\nextending these factorization theorems to increasingly differential jet\nsubstructure observables, the focus has been primarily on infrared safe\nobservables sensitive only to correlations in the energy of final state\nhadrons. However, significant information about the dynamics of the underlying\ncollision is encoded in how energy is correlated between hadrons of different\nquantum numbers. In this paper we extend the class of calculable correlations\nby deriving factorization theorems for a broad class of correlations, $\\langle\n\\mathcal{E}_{R_1}(n_1) \\cdots \\mathcal{E}_{R_k}(n_k) \\rangle$, between the\nenergy flux carried by hadrons specified by quantum numbers, $R_1, \\cdots,\nR_k$. We show that these factorization theorems involve moments of a new class\nof universal non-perturbative functions, the \"joint track functions\", which\nextend the track function formalism to describe the fraction of energy carried\nby hadrons of multiple quantum numbers arising from the fragmentation of quarks\nor gluons. We study the general properties of these functions, and then apply\nthis to the specific case of joint track functions for positive and negative\nelectromagnetic charges. We extract these from parton shower Monte Carlo\nprograms and use them to calculate correlations in electromagnetically charged\nenergy flux. We additionally propose and study a C-odd\n$\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{Q}}$ detector, which results in a qualitatively distinct\nscaling behavior compared to the standard energy correlators. Our formalism\nsignificantly extends the class of observables that can be computed at hadron\ncolliders, with a wide range of applications from particle to nuclear physics.\n",

    "abstract": "  Quantum states obey an asymptotic no-cloning theorem, stating that no\ndeterministic machine can reliably replicate generic sequences of identically\nprepared pure states. In stark contrast, we show that generic sequences of\nunitary gates can be replicated deterministically at nearly quadratic rates,\nwith an error vanishing on most inputs except for an exponentially small\nfraction. The result is not in contradiction with the no-cloning theorem, since\nthe impossibility of deterministically transforming pure states into unitary\ngates prevents the application of the gate replication protocol to states. In\naddition to gate replication, we show that $N$ parallel uses of a completely\nunknown unitary gate can be compressed into a single gate acting on $O(\\log N)$\nqubits, leading to an exponential reduction of the amount of quantum\ncommunication needed to implement the gate remotely.\n",

    "abstract": "  This thesis is concerned with the design of distributed algorithms for\nsolving optimization problems. We consider networks where each node has\nexclusive access to a cost function, and design algorithms that make all nodes\ncooperate to find the minimum of the sum of all the cost functions. Several\nproblems in signal processing, control, and machine learning can be posed as\nsuch optimization problems. Given that communication is often the most\nenergy-consuming operation in networks, it is important to design\ncommunication-efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this thesis are a\nclassification scheme for distributed optimization and a set of corresponding\ncommunication-efficient algorithms.\n  The class of optimization problems we consider is quite general, since each\nfunction may depend on arbitrary components of the optimization variable, and\nnot necessarily on all of them. In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption\nin distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to\nreduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our\nclassification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for\nexample the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions\ndepend on all the components of the variable.\n  In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the\ncommunications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with\neach node is processed locally. We show several applications including average\nconsensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed\nscenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for\ndistributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments,\nwe show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of\ncommunication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a\nparticular application.\n",

    "abstract": "  We derive the masses acquired at one loop by massless scalars in the\nNeumann-Dirichlet sector of open strings, when supersymmetry is spontaneously\nbroken. It is done by computing two-point functions of \"boundary-changing\nvertex operators\" inserted on the boundaries of the annulus and M\\\"obius strip.\nThis requires the evaluation of correlators of \"excited boundary-changing\nfields,\" which are analogous to excited twist fields for closed strings. We\nwork in the type IIB orientifold theory compactified on $T^2\\times\nT^4/\\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry is broken to\n$\\mathcal{N}=0$ by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism implemented along $T^2$. Even\nthough the full expression of the squared masses is complicated, it reduces to\na very simple form when the lowest scale of the background is the supersymmetry\nbreaking scale $M_{3/2}$. We apply our results to analyze in this regime the\nstability at the quantum level of the moduli fields arising in the\nNeumann-Dirichlet sector. This completes the study of Ref. [32], where the\nquantum masses of all other types of moduli arising in the open- or\nclosed-string sectors are derived. Ultimately, we identify all brane\nconfigurations that produce backgrounds without tachyons at one loop and yield\nan effective potential exponentially suppressed, or strictly positive with\nrunaway behavior of $M_{3/2}$.\n",

Excitations in this\nsystem are first considered within the framework of bosonization and Luttinger\nliquid theory which are applicable if the Luttinger liquid parameters are\ndetermined numerically. The occurrence of a bosonic counterpart of fermionic\nspin-charge separation is signalled by a characteristic two-peak structure in\nthe spectral functions found by dynamical DMRG in good agreement with\nanalytical predictions. Experimentally, single-particle excitations as probed\nby spectral functions are currently not accessible in cold atoms. We therefore\nconsider the modifications needed for current experiments, namely the\ninvestigation of the real-time evolution of density perturbations instead of\nsingle particle excitations, a slight inequivalence between the two\nintraspecies interactions in actual experiments, and the presence of a\nconfining trap potential. Using time-dependent DMRG we show that only\nquantitative modifications occur. With an eye to the simulation of strongly\ncorrelated quantum systems far from equilibrium we detect a strong dependence\nof the time-evolution of entanglement entropy on the initial perturbation,\nsignalling limitations to current reasonings on entanglement growth in\nmany-body systems.\n",

The Speakerfilter\nuses a bi-direction gated recurrent unit (BGRU) module to characterize the\ntarget speaker from anchor speech and use a convolutional recurrent network\n(CRN) module to separate the target speech from a noisy signal.Different from\nthe Speakerfilter, the Speakerfilter-Pro sticks a WaveUNet module in the\nbeginning and the ending, respectively. The WaveUNet has been proven to have a\nbetter ability to perform speech separation in the time domain. In order to\nextract the target speaker information better, the complex spectrum instead of\nthe magnitude spectrum is utilized as the input feature for the CRN module.\nExperiments are conducted on the two-speaker dataset (WSJ0-mix2) which is\nwidely used for speaker extraction. The systematic evaluation shows that the\nSpeakerfilter-Pro outperforms the Speakerfilter and other baselines, and\nachieves a signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) of 14.95 dB.\n",

Despite its wide usage in practice, no global convergence\nguarantees for this algorithm are known. In this paper, we show that a\n(resampling) variant of this approach converges geometrically to the solution\nof one such problem -- finding a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ from\n$\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{y} =\n\\left|\\mathbf{A}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}\\right|$ and $|\\mathbf{z}|$ denotes a vector\nof element-wise magnitudes of $\\mathbf{z}$ -- under the assumption that\n$\\mathbf{A}$ is Gaussian.\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating minimization performs similar to\nrecently proposed convex techniques for this problem (which are based on\n\"lifting\" to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to\nnoise. However, it is much more efficient and can scale to large problems.\nAnalytically, for a resampling version of alternating minimization, we show\ngeometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log\nfactors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling\nfor the case when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the first\ntheoretical guarantee for alternating minimization (albeit with resampling) for\nany variant of phase retrieval problems in the non-convex setting.\n",

    "abstract": "  A fully quantized field theory is developped for the skyrmion topological\nexcitations of the O(3) symmetric CP$^1$-Nonlinear Sigma Model in 2+1D. The\nmethod allows for the obtainment of arbitrary correlation functions of quantum\nskyrmion fields. The two-point function is evaluated in three different\nsituations: a) the pure theory; b) the case when it is coupled to fermions\nwhich are otherwise non-interacting and c) the case when an electromagnetic\ninteraction among the fermions is introduced. The quantum skyrmion mass is\nexplicitly obtained in each case from the large distance behavior of the\ntwo-point function and the skyrmion statistics is inferred from an analysis of\nthe phase of this function. The ratio between the quantum and classical\nskyrmion masses is obtained, confirming the tendency, observed in semiclassical\ncalculations, that quantum effects will decrease the skyrmion mass. A brief\ndiscussion of asymptotic skyrmion states, based on the short distance behavior\nof the two-point function, is also presented.\n",

We consider the optical Glauber model as an initial model of the\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the solution of the Maxwell equations with source\nterm of the charged particles in two colliding nuclei as initial\nelectromagnetic fields. The RRMHD simulation is performed with these initial\nconditions in Au-Au and Cu-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV.\nWe have calculated the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow $\\Delta\nv_1$ and elliptic flow $\\Delta v_2$ in both collisions based on electric charge\ndistributions as a consequence of RRMHD. Our results show that the $\\Delta v_1$\nand $\\Delta v_2$ are approximately proportional to the electrical conductivity\n($\\sigma$) of the medium. In the $\\sigma=0.023~\\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ case, our\nresult of $\\Delta v_1$ is consistent with STAR data in Au-Au collisions.\nFurthermore, in Cu-Au collisions, $\\Delta v_1$ has a non-zero value at $\\eta =\n0$. We conclude that the charge-dependent anisotropic flow is a good probe to\nextract the electrical conductivity of the QGP medium in high-energy heavy-ion\nexperiments.\n",

    "abstract": "  An idealized high entropy oxide is characterized by perfect chemical disorder\nand perfect positional order. In this work, we investigate the extent to which\nshort-range order (SRO) and local structural distortions impede that idealized\nscenario. Working in the entropy stabilized $\\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, we\ncompare a two-component system, (Ti,Zr)O$_2$, with a four-component system,\n(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_2$, using a combination of experimental and computational\napproaches. Special quasi-random structures are used in conjunction with\ndensity functional theory calculations to investigate the local distortions\naround specific elements revealing significant local distortions that are\nrelatively insensitive to the number of chemical constituents. Using finite\ntemperature Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the previously\nexperimentally observed SRO and transition temperature for the two-component\nsystem. However, the ideal configurational entropy is never reached, so SRO is\nexpected even at synthesis temperatures. On the other hand, the order-disorder\ntransition temperature is dramatically lower and experimentally inaccessible\nfor the four-component system, while the configurational entropy is closer to\nideal and less sensitive to temperature. Total scattering measurements and pair\ndistribution function analysis of slow-cooled and quenched samples support this\nview. In general, we demonstrate that SRO effects in high entropy materials are\nless prevalent as more components are added in, provided the pairwise\ninteraction strengths remain comparable, while local distortions are less\naffected by the number of components.\n",

The controversy between\ndominance of close- or remote-collision contributions to Coulomb correction is\ndiscussed. For scattering centres represented by a Coulomb potential with a\ngeneric (not necessarily spherically symmetric) creening function, the Coulomb\ncorrection is proven to be screening-independent, by virtue of the eikonal\nphase cancellation in regions distant from the Coulomb singularity. Treating\nthe atom %more self-consistently, as an assembly of pointlike electrons and the\nnucleus, and summing the scattering probability over all the final atom states,\nit is shown that besides the Coulomb correction due to close encounters of the\nincident charged particle with atomic nuclei, there are similar corrections due\nto close encounters with atomic electrons (an analog of Bloch correction). For\nlow $Z\\neq1$ the latter contribution can reach $\\sim 25\\%$, but its observation\nis partly obscured by multiple scattering effects.\n",

    "abstract": "  This paper presents score-based sequential Langevin sampling (SSLS), a novel\napproach to nonlinear data assimilation within a recursive Bayesian framework.\nThe proposed method decomposes the assimilation process into alternating\nprediction and update steps, leveraging dynamic models for state prediction\nwhile incorporating observational data through score-based Langevin Monte Carlo\nduring updates. To address challenges in posterior sampling, we introduce an\nannealing strategy within the update mechanism. We provide theoretical\nguarantees for SSLS convergence in total variation (TV) distance under certain\nconditions, providing insights into error behavior with respect to key\nhyper-parameters. Our numerical experiments across challenging scenarios --\nincluding high-dimensional systems, strong nonlinearity, and sparse\nobservations -- demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, SSLS effectively quantifies the uncertainty associated with the\nestimated states, making it particularly valuable for the error calibration.\n",

    "abstract": "  Spatial, amplitude and phase variations in spatial functional data are\nconfounded. Conclusions from the popular functional trace variogram, which\nquantifies spatial variation, can be misleading when analysing misaligned\nfunctional data with phase variation. To remedy this, we describe a framework\nthat extends amplitude-phase separation methods in functional data to the\nspatial setting, with a view towards performing clustering and spatial\nprediction. We propose a decomposition of the trace variogram into amplitude\nand phase components and quantify how spatial correlations between functional\nobservations manifest in their respective amplitude and phase components. This\nenables us to generate separate amplitude and phase clustering methods for\nspatial functional data, and develop a novel spatial functional interpolant at\nunobserved locations based on combining separate amplitude and phase\npredictions. Through simulations and real data analyses, we found that the\nproposed methods result in more accurate predictions and more interpretable\nclustering results.\n",

A distance k-sector of P and Q, where\nk is an integer, is a (k-1)-tuple (C_1, C_2, ..., C_{k-1}) such that C_i is the\nbisector of C_{i-1} and C_{i+1} for every i = 1, 2, ..., k-1, where C_0 = P and\nC_k = Q. This notion, for the case where P and Q are points in Euclidean plane,\nwas introduced by Asano, Matousek, and Tokuyama, motivated by a question of\nMurata in VLSI design. They established the existence and uniqueness of the\ndistance trisector in this special case. We prove the existence of a distance\nk-sector for all k and for every two disjoint, nonempty, closed sets P and Q in\nEuclidean spaces of any (finite) dimension, or more generally, in proper\ngeodesic spaces (uniqueness remains open). The core of the proof is a new\nnotion of k-gradation for P and Q, whose existence (even in an arbitrary metric\nspace) is proved using the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem, by a method\nintroduced by Reem and Reich for a slightly different purpose.\n",

Here\nwe quantify the uncertainty in the predicted evolution of SLRs within a parcel\nof interstellar gas given the stochastic nature of stellar enrichment events.\nWe assume that an enrichment progenitor is formed at every time interval\n$\\gamma$. For each progenitor, we randomly sample the delay time between its\nformation and its enrichment event, based on several delay-time distribution\n(DTD) functions that cover a wide range of astrophysical sites. For each set of\n$\\tau$, $\\gamma$, and DTD function, we follow the abundances of SLRs for 15\nGyr, and repeat this process thousands of times to derive their probability\ndistributions. For $\\tau/\\gamma\\gtrsim2$, the distributions depend on the DTD\nfunction and we provide tabulated values and analytical expressions to quantify\nthe spread. The relative abundance uncertainty reaches a maximum of $\\sim$ 60%\nfor $\\tau/\\gamma=1$. For $\\tau/\\gamma\\lesssim1$, we provide the probability for\nthe SLR abundance to carry the signature of only one enrichment event, which is\ngreater than 50% when $\\tau/\\gamma\\lesssim0.3$. For\n$0.3\\lesssim\\tau/\\gamma\\lesssim 2$, a small number of events contributed to the\nSLR abundance. This case needs to be investigated with a separate statistical\nmethod. We find that an isolation time for the birth of the Sun of roughly\n$9-13$ Myr is consistent with the observed abundances of $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd,\nand $^{182}$Hf in the early Solar System, when assuming $\\tau/\\gamma\\sim3$ for\nthese isotopes.\n",

    "abstract": "  In Federated Learning (FL), a global statistical model is developed by\nencouraging mobile users to perform the model training on their local data and\naggregating the output local model parameters in an iterative manner. However,\ndue to limited energy and computation capability at the mobile devices, the\nperformance of the model training is always at stake to meet the objective of\nlocal energy minimization. In this regard, Multi-access Edge Computing\n(MEC)-enabled FL addresses the tradeoff between the model performance and the\nenergy consumption of the mobile devices by allowing users to offload a portion\nof their local dataset to an edge server for the model training. Since the edge\nserver has high computation capability, the time consumption of the model\ntraining at the edge server is insignificant. However, the time consumption for\ndataset offloading from mobile users to the edge server has a significant\nimpact on the total time consumption. Thus, resource management in MEC-enabled\nFL is challenging, where the objective is to reduce the total time consumption\nwhile saving the energy consumption of the mobile devices. In this paper, we\nformulate an energy-aware resource management for MEC-enabled FL in which the\nmodel training loss and the total time consumption are jointly minimized, while\nconsidering the energy limitation of mobile devices. In addition, we recast the\nformulated problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) to capture\nthe coupling constraints between the radio resource management and dataset\noffloading. We then analyze the impact of the dataset offloading and computing\nresource allocation on the model training loss, time, and the energy\nconsumption.\n",

    "abstract": "  The problem of posterior inference is central to Bayesian statistics and a\nwealth of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been proposed to obtain\nasymptotically correct samples from the posterior. As datasets in applications\ngrow larger and larger, scalability has emerged as a central problem for MCMC\nmethods. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and related stochastic\ngradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods offer scalability by using stochastic\ngradients in each step of the simulated dynamics. While these methods are\nasymptotically unbiased if the stepsizes are reduced in an appropriate fashion,\nin practice constant stepsizes are used. This introduces a bias that is often\nignored. In this paper we study the mean squared error of Lipschitz functionals\nin strongly log- concave models with i.i.d. data of growing data set size and\nshow that, given a batchsize, to control the bias of SGLD the stepsize has to\nbe chosen so small that the computational cost of reaching a target accuracy is\nroughly the same for all batchsizes. Using a control variate approach, the cost\ncan be reduced dramatically. The analysis is performed by considering the\nalgorithms as noisy discretisations of the Langevin SDE which correspond to the\nEuler method if the full data set is used. An important observation is that the\n1scale of the step size is determined by the stability criterion if the\naccuracy is required for consistent credible intervals. Experimental results\nconfirm our theoretical findings.\n",

Unfortunately, it is impossible or extremely\ndifficult to obtain an explicit distribution of this sample correlation\ncoefficient. To address this challenge, we employ extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations to obtain the empirical distribution of the sample correlation\ncoefficient from the Birnbaum-Saunders probability plot. This empirical\ndistribution allows us to determine the critical values alongside their\ncorresponding significance levels, thus facilitating the computation of the\np-value when the sample correlation coefficient is obtained. Finally, two\nreal-data examples are provided for illustrative purposes.\n",

    "abstract": "  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) encounter a large volume of data which is added\nto the system gradually in real time and not altogether in advance. As the\nvolume of data increases, the domain of the control strategies also increases,\nand thus it becomes challenging to search for an optimal strategy. Even if an\noptimal control strategy is found, implementing such strategies with increasing\ndomains is burdensome. To derive an optimal control strategy in CPS, we\ntypically assume an ideal model of the system. Such model-based control\napproaches cannot effectively facilitate optimal solutions with performance\nguarantees due to the discrepancy between the model and the actual CPS.\nAlternatively, traditional supervised learning approaches cannot always\nfacilitate robust solutions using data derived offline. Similarly, applying\nreinforcement learning approaches directly to the actual CPS might impose\nsignificant implications on safety and robust operation of the system. The goal\nof this chapter is to provide a theoretical framework that aims at separating\nthe control and learning tasks which allows us to combine offline model-based\ncontrol with online learning approaches, and thus circumvent the challenges in\nderiving optimal control strategies for CPS.\n",

However, most existing\nworks resort to taking discrete snapshots of the temporal graph, or are not\ninductive to deal with new nodes, or do not model the exciting effects which is\nthe ability of events to influence the occurrence of another event. In this\nwork, We propose TREND, a novel framework for temporal graph representation\nlearning, driven by TempoRal Event and Node Dynamics and built upon a Hawkes\nprocess-based graph neural network (GNN). TREND presents a few major\nadvantages: (1) it is inductive due to its GNN architecture; (2) it captures\nthe exciting effects between events by the adoption of the Hawkes process; (3)\nas our main novelty, it captures the individual and collective characteristics\nof events by integrating both event and node dynamics, driving a more precise\nmodeling of the temporal process. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n",

    "abstract": "  The standard model for giant planet formation is based on the accretion of\nsolids by a growing planetary embryo, followed by rapid gas accretion once the\nplanet exceeds a so-called critical mass. The dominant size of the accreted\nsolids (cm-size particles named pebbles or km to hundred km-size bodies named\nplanetesimals) is, however, unknown. Recently, high-precision measurements of\nisotopes in meteorites provided evidence for the existence of two reservoirs in\nthe early Solar System. These reservoirs remained separated from ~1 until ~ 3\nMyr after the beginning of the Solar System's formation. This separation is\ninterpreted as resulting from Jupiter growing and becoming a barrier for\nmaterial transport. In this framework, Jupiter reached ~20 Earth masses within\n~1 Myr and slowly grew to ~50 Earth masses in the subsequent 2 Myr before\nreaching its present-day mass. The evidence that Jupiter slowed down its growth\nafter reaching 20 Earth masses for at least 2 Myr is puzzling because a planet\nof this mass is expected to trigger fast runaway gas accretion. Here, we use\ntheoretical models to describe the conditions allowing for such a slow\naccretion and show that Jupiter grew in three distinct phases. First, rapid\npebble accretion brought the major part of Jupiter's core mass. Second, slow\nplanetesimal accretion provided the energy required to hinder runaway gas\naccretion during 2 Myr. Third, runaway gas accretion proceeded. Both pebbles\nand planetesimals therefore have an important role in Jupiter's formation.\n",

    "abstract": "  Microlensing of extragalactic sources, in particular the probability of\nsignificant amplifications, is a potentially powerful probe of the abundance of\ncompact objects outside the halo of the Milky Way. Accurate experimental\nconstraints require an equally accurate theoretical model for the amplification\nstatistics produced by such a population. In this article, we argue that the\nsimplest (strongest-lens) model does not meet this demanding requirement. We\nthus propose an elaborate practical modelling scheme for extragalactic\nmicrolensing. We derive from first principles an expression for the\namplification probability that consistently allows for: (i) the coupling\nbetween microlenses; (ii) realistic perturbations from the cosmic large-scale\nstructure; (iii) extended-source corrections. An important conclusion is that\nthe external shear applied on the dominant microlens, both by the other lenses\nand by the large-scale structure, is practically negligible. Yet, the\npredictions of our approach can still differ by a factor of a few with respect\nto existing models of the literature. Updated constraints on the abundance of\ncompact objects accounting for such discrepancies may be required.\n",

    "abstract": "  Studying human factors has gained a lot of interest in recommender systems\nresearch recently. User experience plays a vital role in tourism recommender\nsystems since user satisfaction is the main factor that guarantees the success\nof such recommender systems. In this work, we have designed and implemented a\ndestination recommender system in which the recommendations adapt instantly\nbased on the user preferences. The recommendations can be explored on a world\nmap with additional information. This interface addresses common visualization\nchallenges in recommender systems, such as transparency, justification,\ncontrollability, explorability, the cold-start problem, and context awareness.\nWe have conducted a user study to evaluate different aspects of this\nrecommender system from the users' perspective.\n",

    "abstract": "  The electronic structures of a representative rare earth monopnictide (i.e.,\nDySb) under high magnetic field (i.e., in the ferromagnetic state) are studied\nfrom both experimental and theoretical aspects. A non-saturated extremely large\npositive magnetoresistance (XMR) is observed (as large as 3.7*10^4% at 1.8 K\nand 38.7 T), along with the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations that are well\nreproduced by our first principles calculations. Three possible origins of XMR\nare examined. Although a band inversion is found theoretically, suggesting that\nDySb might be topologically nontrivial, it is deeply underneath the Fermi\nlevel, which rules out a topological nature of the XMR. The total densities of\nelectron-like and hole-like carriers are not fully compensated, showing that\ncompensation is unlikely to account for the XMR. The XMR is eventually\nunderstood in terms of high mobility that is associated with the steep linear\nbands. This discovery is important to the intensive studies on the XMR of rare\nearth monopnictides.\n",

    "abstract": "  Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume\nof digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns\nin uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on\nthe selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study\nargues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the\npotential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual\nembeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering\nalgorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments\nwere conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the\nrole of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of\nmodel size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing\nsubtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better\nresults in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets.\nMost LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more\ninformative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of\ntext data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models,\nBERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that\nincreasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not\nconsistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies\nrequire careful consideration for practical application. These results\nhighlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation\nand computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study\nextends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from\nLLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future\nresearch in various types of textual analysis.\n",

Classical euclidean solutions starting from the\nclassical vacuum play an important role in constructing such asymptotics.

    "abstract": "  One major challenge in training Deep Neural Networks is preventing\noverfitting. Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers\nsuch as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a\nmassive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer\ncalled DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by\nthe difference between train and val performance), and better generalization.\nOur regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep\nNeural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This\nsimple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly\nhas never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning. Experiments\nacross a range of datasets and network architectures show that this loss always\nreduces overfitting while almost always maintaining or increasing\ngeneralization performance and often improving performance over Dropout.\n",

The model is semiclassical\nin nature and uses as a source of gravity the effective stress-energy tensor\n(SET) corresponding to vacuum polarization of quantum fields, and a minimum\nspherical radius is a few orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, so\nthat the effects of quantum gravity should be still negligible. We estimate the\nother quantum contributions to the effective SET, caused by a nontrivial\ntopology of spatial sections and particle production from vacuum due to a\nnonstationary gravitational field and show that these contributions are\nnegligibly small as compared to the SET due to vacuum polarization. The same is\nshown for such classical phenomena as accretion of different kinds of matter to\nthe black hole and its further motion to the would-be singularity. Thus, in a\nclear sense, our model of a semiclassical bounce instead of a Schwarzschild\nsingularity is stable under both quantum and classical perturbations.\n",

    "abstract": "  Higgs inflation has received a remarkable attention in the last few years due\nto its simplicity and predictive power. The key point of this model is the\nnonminimal coupling to gravity in unitary gauge. As such, this theory is in\nfact a scalar-tensor modification of gravity that needs to be studied also\nbelow the energy scales of inflation. Motivated by this goal, we study in great\nanalytical and numerical detail the static and spherically symmetric solutions\nof the equations of motion in the presence of standard baryonic matter, called\n\"Higgs monopoles\" and presented in 1305.2640. These particlelike solutions may\narise naturally in tensor-scalar gravity with mexican hat potential and are the\nonly globally regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite classical\nenergy. In the case when the parameters of the potential are taken to be the\nones of the standard model, we find that the deviations from general relativity\nare extremely small, especially for bodies of astrophysical size and density.\nThis allows to derive a simplified description of the monopole, for which the\nmetric inside the spherical matter distribution can be approximated by the\nstandard metric of general relativity. We study how the properties of these\nmonopoles depend on the strength of the nonminimal coupling to gravity and on\nthe baryonic mass and compactness. An important and original result is the\nexistence of a mechanism of resonant amplification of the Higgs field inside\nthe monopole that comes into play for large nonminimal coupling. We show that\nthis mechanism might degenerate into divergences of the Higgs field that reveal\nthe existence of forbidden combinations of radius and baryonic energy density.\n",

    "abstract": "  Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate\nsuperconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous.\nHowever, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a\ntheoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting\n$d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we\nfocus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting\norder-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches\ntiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value\nof the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to\nstudy how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various\nmeasures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the\nlength scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting\ncoherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous.\nHowever, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length,\nwe find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the\nlow-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly\ninhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating\nthe homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap\nextracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find\nin both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower\nthan that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of\nthe patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment\non the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations\nof the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field\ncorrelation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.\n",

    "abstract": "  In the sport of cricket, variations in a player's batting ability can usually\nbe measured on one of two scales. Short-term changes in ability that are\nobserved during a single innings, and long-term changes that are witnessed\nbetween matches, over entire playing careers. To measure long-term variations,\nwe derive a Bayesian parametric model that uses a Gaussian process to measure\nand predict how the batting abilities of international cricketers fluctuate\nbetween innings. The model is fitted using nested sampling given its high\ndimensionality and for ease of model comparison. Generally speaking, the\nresults support an anecdotal description of a typical sporting career. Young\nplayers tend to begin their careers with some raw ability, which improves over\ntime as a result of coaching, experience and other external circumstances.\nEventually, players reach the peak of their career, after which ability tends\nto decline. The model provides more accurate quantifications of current and\nfuture player batting abilities than traditional cricketing statistics, such as\nthe batting average. The results allow us to identify which players are\nimproving or deteriorating in terms of batting ability, which has practical\nimplications in terms of player comparison, talent identification and team\nselection policy.\n",

    "abstract": "  Identifying the relationship between healthcare attributes, lifestyles, and\npersonality is vital for understanding and improving physical and mental\nwell-being. Machine learning approaches are promising for modeling their\nrelationships and offering actionable suggestions. In this paper, we propose\nthe Virtual Human Generative Model (VHGM), a novel deep generative model\ncapable of estimating over 2,000 attributes across healthcare, lifestyle, and\npersonality domains. VHGM leverages masked modeling to learn the joint\ndistribution of attributes, enabling accurate predictions and robust\nconditional sampling. We deploy VHGM as a web service, showcasing its\nversatility in driving diverse healthcare applications aimed at improving user\nwell-being. Through extensive quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate VHGM's\nsuperior performance in attribute imputation and high-quality sample generation\ncompared to existing baselines. This work highlights VHGM as a powerful tool\nfor personalized healthcare and lifestyle management, with broad implications\nfor data-driven health solutions.\n",

    "abstract": "  Link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) is a key research topic. Previous\nwork mainly focused on binary relations, paying less attention to higher-arity\nrelations although they are ubiquitous in real-world KGs. This paper considers\nlink prediction upon n-ary relational facts and proposes a graph-based approach\nto this task. The key to our approach is to represent the n-ary structure of a\nfact as a small heterogeneous graph, and model this graph with edge-biased\nfully-connected attention. The fully-connected attention captures universal\ninter-vertex interactions, while with edge-aware attentive biases to\nparticularly encode the graph structure and its heterogeneity. In this fashion,\nour approach fully models global and local dependencies in each n-ary fact, and\nhence can more effectively capture associations therein. Extensive evaluation\nverifies the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It performs\nsubstantially and consistently better than current state-of-the-art across a\nvariety of n-ary relational benchmarks. Our code is publicly available.\n",

    "abstract": "  Collisional models are a category of microscopic framework designed to study\nopen quantum systems. The framework involves a system sequentially interacting\nwith a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum\nhomogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically\nprepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Here, we study the\nhomogenization process for a single qubit in the non-Markovian collisional\nmodel framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial\nswap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we numerically\ndemonstrate that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states\nof the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario,\nwhere partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer.\nOn the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than\nits Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath\nunitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality, being\ndependent on the initial states of the bath units.\n",

    "abstract": "  The rapidly evolving field of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has made\nsignificant strides in automating repetitive processes, yet its effectiveness\ndiminishes in scenarios requiring spontaneous or unpredictable tasks demanded\nby users. This paper introduces a novel approach, FlowMind, leveraging the\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pretrained\nTransformer (GPT), to address this limitation and create an automatic workflow\ngeneration system. In FlowMind, we propose a generic prompt recipe for a\nlecture that helps ground LLM reasoning with reliable Application Programming\nInterfaces (APIs). With this, FlowMind not only mitigates the common issue of\nhallucinations in LLMs, but also eliminates direct interaction between LLMs and\nproprietary data or code, thus ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of\ninformation - a cornerstone in financial services. FlowMind further simplifies\nuser interaction by presenting high-level descriptions of auto-generated\nworkflows, enabling users to inspect and provide feedback effectively. We also\nintroduce NCEN-QA, a new dataset in finance for benchmarking question-answering\ntasks from N-CEN reports on funds. We used NCEN-QA to evaluate the performance\nof workflows generated by FlowMind against baseline and ablation variants of\nFlowMind. We demonstrate the success of FlowMind, the importance of each\ncomponent in the proposed lecture recipe, and the effectiveness of user\ninteraction and feedback in FlowMind.\n",

    "abstract": "  We evaluate the LHC discovery potential for a light Higgs boson in t tbar H\n(-> l nu b bbar b bbar jj) production, within the Standard Model and if a new\nQ=2/3 quark singlet T with a moderate mass exists. In the latter case, T pair\nproduction with decays T Tbar -> W+ b H tbar / H t W- bbar -> W+ b W- bbar H\nprovides an important additional source of Higgs bosons giving the same\nexperimental signature, and other decay modes T Tbar -> H t H tbar -> W+ b W-\nbbar H H, T Tbar -> Z t H tbar / H t Z tbar -> W+ b W- bbar H Z further enhance\nthis signal. Both analyses are carried out with particle-level simulations of\nsignals and backgrounds, including t tbar plus n=0...5 jets which constitute\nthe main background by far. Our estimate for SM Higgs discovery in t tbar H\nproduction, 0.4 sigma significance for M_H = 115 GeV and an integrated\nluminosity of 30 fb^-1, is similar to the most recent ones by CMS which also\ninclude the full t tbar nj background. We show that, if a quark singlet with a\nmass m_T = 500 GeV exists, the luminosity required for Higgs discovery in this\nfinal state is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, and 5 sigma\nsignificance can be achieved already with 8 fb^-1. This new Higgs signal will\nnot be seen unless we look for it: with this aim, a new specific final state\nreconstruction method is presented. Finally, we consider the sensitivity to\nsearch for Q=2/3 singlets. The combination of these three decay modes allows to\ndiscover a 500 GeV quark with 7 fb^-1 of luminosity.\n",

As a key\nresult the local dilation function is calculated at a state when the state\nargument is bound to vary along certain parameterized curves passing through\nthis state. The parameterized curves considered are those possessing\ndifferentiable local implementations as vector states relative to some unital\n*-representation in the vicinity of the state in question. The space of all\ntangent forms at a given state correspondent to this category of curves is\nspecified as normed linear space with a quadratic norm which is depending from\nthe state in a characteristic manner. In analyzing the structure of the local\ndilation function special emphasis is laid on describing such parts of the\nstate space, in restriction to which the line element would be of Finslerian\ntype, and which were geodesically convex subsets. All results obtained are\nillustrated by examples, and the implications obtained are compared to those\nknown from the investigations of Uhlmann et al in the finite dimensional case.\n",

    "abstract": "  Financial markets can be seen as complex systems in non-equilibrium steady\nstate, one of whose most important properties is the distribution of price\nfluctuations. Recently, there have been assertions that this distribution is\nqualitatively different in emerging markets as compared to developed markets.\nHere we analyse both high-frequency tick-by-tick as well as daily closing price\ndata to show that the price fluctuations in the Indian stock market, one of the\nlargest emerging markets, have a distribution that is identical to that\nobserved for developed markets (e.g., NYSE). In particular, the cumulative\ndistribution has a long tail described by a power law with an exponent $\\alpha\n\\approx 3$. Also, we study the historical evolution of this distribution over\nthe period of existence of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, which\ncoincided with the rapid transformation of the Indian economy due to\nliberalization, and show that this power law tail has been present almost\nthroughout. We conclude that the ``inverse cubic law'' is a truly universal\nfeature of a financial market, independent of its stage of development or the\ncondition of the underlying economy.\n",

The basic idea of the factorization method applied on such a system\nis to control some observables in order to determine and sample efficiently the\nregion of configuration space which gives important contribution to the\npartition function. We argue that it is crucial to choose appropriately the set\nof the observables to be controlled in order for the method to work\nsuccessfully in a general system. This is demonstrated by an explicit example,\nin which it turns out to be necessary to control more than one observables.\nExtrapolation to large system size is possible due to the nice scaling\nproperties of the factorized functions, and known results obtained by an\nanalytic method are shown to be consistently reproduced.\n",

    "abstract": "  Macroscopic irreversible processes emerge from fundamental physical laws of\nreversible character. The source of the local irreversibility seems to be not\nin the laws themselves but in the initial and boundary conditions of the\nequations that represent the laws. In this work we propose that the screening\nof currents by black hole event horizons determines, locally, a preferred\ndirection for the flux of electromagnetic energy. We study the growth of black\nhole event horizons due to the cosmological expansion and accretion of cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, for different cosmological models. We propose\ngeneralized McVittie co-moving metrics and integrate the rate of accretion of\ncosmic microwave background radiation onto a supermassive black hole over\ncosmic time. We find that for flat, open, and closed Friedmann cosmological\nmodels, the ratio of the total area of the black hole event horizons with\nrespect to the area of a radial co-moving space-like hypersurface always\nincreases. Since accretion of cosmic radiation sets an absolute lower limit to\nthe total matter accreted by black holes, this implies that the causal past and\nfuture are not mirror symmetric for any spacetime event. The asymmetry causes a\nnet Poynting flux in the global future direction; the latter is in turn related\nto the ever increasing thermodynamic entropy. Thus, we expose a connection\nbetween four different \"time arrows\": cosmological, electromagnetic,\ngravitational, and thermodynamic.\n",

Notwithstanding their completely different\nmorphologies and jumping strategies, these legged and legless animals have\nconvergently evolved to jump with a take-off angle of 60$^\\circ$, which differs\nsignificantly from the leap angle of 45$^\\circ$ that allows reaching maximum\nrange. We show that in the presence of uniformly-distributed random obstacles\nthe probability of a successful jump is directly proportional to the area under\nthe trajectory. In the presence of negligible air drag, the probability is\nmaximized by a take-off angle of 60$^\\circ$.\n  The numerical calculation of the trajectories shows that they are\nsignificantly affected by air drag, but the maximum probability of a successful\njump still occurs for a take-off angle of 59-60$^\\circ$ in a wide range of the\ndimensionless Reynolds and Froude numbers that control the process. We discuss\nthe implications of our results for the exploration of unknown environments\nsuch as planets and disaster scenarios by using jumping robots.\n",

    "abstract": "  A three-step procedure is proposed in type IIA string theory to stabilize\nmultiple moduli in a dS vacuum. The first step is to construct a progenitor\nmodel with a localized stable supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum, or a discrete\nset of such vacua. It can be done, for example, using two non-perturbative\nexponents in the superpotential for each modulus, as in the KL model. A large\nset of supersymmetric Minkowski vacua with strongly stabilized moduli is\nprotected by a theorem on stability of these vacua in absence of flat\ndirections. The second step involves a parametrically small downshift to a\nsupersymmetric AdS vacuum, which can be achieved by a small change of the\nsuperpotential. The third step is an uplift to a dS vacuum with a positive\ncosmological constant using the $\\overline {D6}$-brane contribution. Stability\nof the resulting dS vacuum is inherited from the stability of the original\nsupersymmetric Minkowski vacuum if the supersymmetry breaking in dS vacuum is\nparametrically small.\n",

Using three\ndifferent sets of observational constraints that include the mass of PSR\nJ0740+6620, the tidal deformability for GW170817, and the mass-radius relation\nfor PSR J0030+0451 from NICER as obligatory (set 1), while set 2 uses the\npossible upper limit on the maximum mass from GW170817 as an additional\nconstraint and set 3 instead of the possibility that the lighter object in the\nasymmetric binary merger GW190814 is a neutron star. We confirm that in any\ncase, the quark matter phase has to be color superconducting with the\ndimensionless diquark coupling approximately fulfilling the Fierz relation\n$\\eta_D=0.75$ and the most probable solutions exhibiting a proportionality\nbetween $\\eta_D$ and $\\eta_V$, the coupling of the repulsive vector interaction\nthat is required for a sufficiently large maximum mass. We used the Bayesian\nanalysis to investigate with the method of fictitious measurements the\nconsequences of anticipating different radii for the massive $2~M_\\odot$ PSR\nJ0740+6220 for the most likely equation of state. With the actual outcome of\nthe NICER radius measurement on PSR J0740+6220 we could conclude that for the\nmost likely hybrid star EoS would not support a maximum mass as large as\n$2.5~M_\\odot$ so that the event GW190814 was a binary black hole merger.\n",

For the case of equal rates, we find the\ncritical graph with minimum number of edges for both one-shot and asymptotic\ncases. For the general case of possibly distinct rates, we show that for\none-shot and asymptotic linear index coding, as well as asymptotic non-linear\nindex coding, each critical graph is a union of disjoint strongly connected\nsubgraphs (USCS). On the other hand, we identify a non-USCS critical graph for\na one-shot non-linear index coding problem. Next, we identify a few graph\nstructures that are critical. We also generalize some of our results to the\ngroupcast problem. In addition, we show that the capacity region of the index\ncoding is additive for union of disjoint graphs.\n",

    "abstract": "  The non-equilibrium gas dynamics is described by the Boltzmann equation,\nwhich can be solved numerically through the deterministic and stochastic\nmethods. Due to the complicated collision term of the Boltzmann equation, many\nkinetic relaxation models have been proposed and used in the past seventy years\nfor the study of rarefied flow. In order to develop a multiscale method for the\nrarefied and continuum flow simulation, by adopting the integral solution of\nthe kinetic model equation a DVM-type unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) has\nbeen constructed. The UGKS models the gas dynamics on the cell size and time\nstep scales while the accumulating effect from particle transport and collision\nhas been taken into account within a time step. Under the UGKS framework, a\nunified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method has been further developed for\nnon-equilibrium flow simulation, where the time evolution of gas distribution\nfunction is composed of analytical wave and individual particle. In the highly\nrarefied regime, particle transport and collision will play a dominant role.\nDue to the single relaxation time model for particle collision, there is a\nnoticeable discrepancy between the UGKWP solution and the full Boltzmann or\nDSMC result, especially in the high Mach and Knudsen number cases. In this\npaper, besides the kinetic relaxation model, a modification of particle\ncollision time according to the particle velocity will be implemented in UGKWP.\nAs a result, the new model greatly improves the performance of UGKWP in the\ncapturing of non-equilibrium flow. There is a perfect match between UGKWP and\nDSMC or Boltzmann solution in the highly rarefied regime. In the near continuum\nand continuum flow regime, the UGKWP will gradually get back to the macroscopic\nvariables based Navier-Stokes flow solver at small cell Knudsen number.\n",

The first is a combined DF-NNC scheme for\nthe one-way relay channel which includes both DF and NNC as special cases by\nperforming rate splitting, partial block Markov encoding and NNC. The second\ncombines two different DF strategies and layered NNC for the two-way relay\nchannel. One DF strategy performs coherent block Markov encoding at the source\nat the cost of power splitting at the relay, the other performs independent\nsource and relay encoding but with full relay power, and layered NNC allows a\ndifferent compression rate for each destination. Analysis and simulation show\nthat both proposed schemes supersede each individual scheme and take full\nadvantage of both DF and NNC.\n",

    "abstract": "  In the domain of chip design, Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) play a\npivotal role. However, due to the complex syntax of HDLs and the limited\navailability of online resources, debugging HDL codes remains a difficult and\ntime-intensive task, even for seasoned engineers. Consequently, there is a\npressing need to develop automated HDL code debugging models, which can\nalleviate the burden on hardware engineers. Despite the strong capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in generating, completing, and debugging software\ncode, their utilization in the specialized field of HDL debugging has been\nlimited and, to date, has not yielded satisfactory results. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-assisted HDL debugging framework, namely HDLdebugger, which\nconsists of HDL debugging data generation via a reverse engineering approach, a\nsearch engine for retrieval-augmented generation, and a retrieval-augmented LLM\nfine-tuning approach. Through the integration of these components, HDLdebugger\ncan automate and streamline HDL debugging for chip design. Our comprehensive\nexperiments, conducted on an HDL code dataset sourced from Huawei, reveal that\nHDLdebugger outperforms 13 cutting-edge LLM baselines, displaying exceptional\neffectiveness in HDL code debugging.\n",

    "abstract": "  The electron-doped Pr(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4) (PCCO) compound in the pseudogap regime\n(x~0.15) was investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and the generalized dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the\nk-dependent self-energy (LDA+DMFT+\\Sigma_k). Model parameters (hopping integral\nvalues and local Coulomb interaction strength) for the effective one-band\nHubbard model were calculated by the local density approximation (LDA) with\nnumerical renormalization group method (NRG) employed as an \"impurity solver\"\nin DMFT computations. An \"external\" k-dependent self-energy \\Sigma_k was used\nto describe interaction of correlated conducting electrons with short-range\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) pseudogap fluctuations. Both experimental and\ntheoretical spectral functions and Fermi surfaces (FS) were obtained and\ncompared demonstrating good semiquantitative agreement. For both experiment and\ntheory normal state spectra of nearly optimally doped PCCO show clear evidence\nfor a pseudogap state with AFM-like nature. Namely, folding of quasiparticle\nbands as well as presence of the \"hot spots\" and \"Fermi arcs\" were observed.\n",

    "abstract": "  We discuss shell-model calculations based on the use of low-momentum\ninteractions derived from the free-space nucleon-nucleon potential. A main\nfeature of this approach is the construction of a smooth potential, V-low-k,\ndefined within a given momentum cutoff. As a practical application of the\ntheoretical framework, we present some selected results of our current study of\nnuclei around doubly magic 132Sn and 208Pb which have been obtained starting\nfrom the CD-Bonn potential. Focusing attention on the similarity between the\nspectroscopy of these two regions, we show that it emerges quite naturally from\nour effective interactions without use of any adjustable parameter.\n",

    "abstract": "  Most biomolecules occur in mirror, or chiral, images of each other. However,\nlife is homochiral: proteins contain almost exclusively levorotatory (L) amino\nacids, while only dextrorotatory (R) sugars appear in RNA and DNA. The\nmechanism behind this fundamental asymmetry of life remains an open problem.\nCoupling the spatiotemporal evolution of a general autocatalytic polymerization\nreaction network to external environmental effects, we show through a detailed\nstatistical analysis that high intensity and long duration events may drive\nachiral initial conditions towards chirality. We argue that life's\nhomochirality resulted from sequential chiral symmetry breaking triggered by\nenvironmental events, thus extending the theory of punctuated equilibrium to\nthe prebiotic realm. Applying our arguments to other potentially life-bearing\nplanetary platforms, we predict that a statistically representative sampling\nwill be racemic on average.\n",
